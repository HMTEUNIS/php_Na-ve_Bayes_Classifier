"BENGALURU, India (AP) — Climate change is battering Asia’s water and power systems and putting millions in harm’s way, forcing countries to pour billions into shoring up basic services, according to two recent reports.

Water-related disasters are rising across the region even as spending to protect communities falls short. Asian nations will need $4 trillion for water and sanitation between 2025 and 2040 — about $250 billion a year, the Asian Development Bank said in a report released Monday.

Governments are under growing pressure to protect power systems people rely on every day. By 2050, extreme weather could leave listed power companies in Asia-Pacific with about $8.4 billion a year in damage and lost revenue, a third higher than now, according to recent research by the Hong Kong-based non-profit Asia Investor Group on Climate Change and the New York-based MSCI Institute, a sustainability think tank.

Those risks have been playing out this year across Asia as it was pummeled by late-arriving storms, relentless rains and severe floods.

In central Vietnam’s Quy Nhon, power lines snapped when Typhoon Kalmaegi blasted the coastal city with heavy rain and strong winds. Floods from the relentless downpours left streets submerged under chest-high water days later, turning entire neighborhoods into islands. The day after the storm made landfall, Hai Duong, 29, rushed to a mall that still had power to charge her phone.

“I can’t go back because my home is underwater. I just want to see if my relatives are safe,” she said.
Asia’s water resources need to be climate proofed

The ADB report says 2.7 billion people, about 60% of the Asia-Pacific population, have access to water for most of their basic needs but more than 4 billion still remain exposed to unsafe water, degraded ecosystems and escalating climate hazards.

Much of the progress since 2013 comes from major gains in rural water access, it says. About 800 million more people in rural areas now have piped water, helping many countries move out of the lowest level of water security. India played a big part in this shift.

But Asia faces a triple threat: environmental pressures, low investment and climate change, said Vivek Raman, principal urban development specialist at the ADB and a lead author of the report.

“It’s a tale of two realities,” Raman said.

The report says water ecosystems were rapidly deteriorating or stagnating in 30 of the 50 Asian countries that were studied, plagued by unchecked development, pollution and land being converted to other uses. Asia also accounts for 41% of global flooding and its coastal megacities and Pacific islands face mounting threats from storm surges, rising sea levels and salty water pushing inland. From 2013 to 2023, Asia and the Pacific experienced 244 major floods, 104 droughts, and 101 severe storms — events that undermined development gains and caused widespread damage.

Governments currently meet only 40% of the estimated $4 trillion in investment, or roughly $250 billion annually, in funding needed for water and sanitation from 2025-2040. That leaves an annual shortfall of over $150 billion.

Asia’s rapid growth is both an opportunity and a challenge said Amit Prothi, director general of New Delhi-based Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, who was not involved with the report. “The amount of infrastructure we’ll build in Asia in the next three decades will be as much as what was built in the last two centuries. So, this is an opportunity to rethink and build in a new way,” he said.

The coalition found that $800 billion in infrastructure, about a third of it in Asia, is exposed to disasters each year globally.
Asia’s power utilities are losing billions due to climate change

Extreme heat, floods and water shortages are already costing Asia’s power utilities $6.3 billion annually, a figure projected to exceed $8.4 billion by 2050 if companies fail to strengthen climate adaptation measures, research by the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change and the MSCI Institute shows.

Asia accounts for 60% of the world’s power generation capacity and remains deeply reliant on coal. The report warns that climate changes threatens both energy security and economic growth across a region where over 4 billion people need reliable electricity.

“Overall, if you were looking at the types of impacts and the preparedness of companies, most companies are at very early stages,” said Anjali Viswamohanan, director of policy at the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change.

Its study of 2,422 power plants across China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and South Korea found extreme heat to be the costliest hazard, responsible for over half of all losses by 2050. Heatwaves reduce power plant efficiency and strain transmission networks. India’s main power utility NTPC, Indonesia’s PLN, and Malaysia’s Tenaga Nasional all face a high risk of disruptions caused by rising heat.
Disruptions to water are a big factor

Another major threat comes from declining river flows in Asia’s major basins, which supply the water needed by coal and gas plants and fuel hydropower dams.

At the same time, heavy rainfall and flooding also pose risks, especially in coastal and riverine regions. Malaysia’s Tenaga Nasional faces some of the highest coastal flood exposure due to power plants built in low-lying areas, the report said.

Despite mounting hazards, most utilities lacked detailed, funded plans for adapting to climate impacts. The report found that while nine companies of the 11 studied assessed how climate change impacts them, only seven examined risks at individual plants. Just five calculated and disclosed how future climate impacts could raise costs or hurt their earnings.

Rapidly shifting climate risks make it hard to predict the costs and insurance needed to protect energy infrastructure, said Jakob Steiner, a geoscientist affiliated with the University of Graz, who wasn’t involved in either report.

Financing gaps in the power sector may be easier to close than those in water and sanitation, since energy projects can attract strong industry interest and investment, he said. But some countries daunted by demands from international investors for environmental safeguards might turn to regional financiers that are less scrupulous about such concerns.

“For energy infrastructure, I see more hope that the financing gap can be closed,” he said. “But that can also come at a cost.”",Climate Change
"Nearly 1,000 people have been killed, and close to one million displaced, Indonesia has said a week after torrential rains triggered catastrophic floods and landslides.

The National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) reported late on Sunday that 961 people had been killed, with 234 people missing and about 5,000 injured across the Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra provinces. The agency also recorded damage to more than 156,000 homes, and 975,075 people had taken refuge in temporary shelters.

Floodwaters have begun to recede in several coastal districts, although large areas in the central highlands are still cut off, BNPB said. However, heavy rain is forecast for parts of the island in the coming days, raising concerns for displaced people.

Indonesia’s rainy season, which usually peaks between November and April, frequently brings severe flooding.

Environmental groups and disaster specialists have warned for years that rapid deforestation, unregulated development and degraded river basins have increased the risks.

Several other countries in Southeast Asia, including Sri Lanka and Thailand, have been hit hard by storms and floods in recent weeks.
Risk to billions

The Asian Water Development Outlook 2025, published by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Monday, warned that the impact of climate change on Asia’s water systems poses a risk to billions.

The research said accelerating ecosystem decline and funding shortfalls for investment in critical water infrastructure threaten to plunge many in the sprawling region into water insecurity.

That could jeopardise gains over the past 12 years that have seen more than 60 percent of Asia-Pacific’s population – about 2.7 billion people – escape extreme water insecurity, the report says.“Asia’s water story is a tale of two realities, with monumental achievements on water security coupled with rising risks that could undermine this progress,” said Norio Saito, the ADB’s senior director for water and urban development.

“Without water security, there is no development,” Saito said, adding that the report showed that urgent action was needed to restore ecosystem health, strengthen resilience, improve water governance, and deploy innovative finance to deliver long-term water security.
Rising disaster threat

The report said ​​extreme weather events such as storm surges, rising sea levels, and saltwater intrusion, along with rising water-related disasters, threaten the region, which already accounts for more than 40 percent of the world’s floods.

That includes the disasters that ravaged Indonesia and other countries in the region in recent weeks.

From 2013 to 2023, the Asia Pacific region experienced 244 major floods, 104 droughts, and 101 severe storms, causing widespread damage to life and property and undermining crucial development gains.The report said accelerating ecosystem decline was also a serious threat to water security in the region, with rivers, aquifers, wetlands and forests that sustain long-term water security deteriorating rapidly.

It said water ecosystems were deteriorating or stagnating in 30 of the 50 Asian countries it looked at, as they face threats from pollution, unchecked development and the conversion of land to other uses.

Underinvestment in water infrastructure is another threat to water security.

Asian nations will need to spend $4 trillion for water and sanitation between now and 2040, an outlay of about $250bn a year, the report said.

Currently, governments are collectively spending about 40 percent of that, an annual shortfall of more than $150bn.",Climate Change

This year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP30, opened in Belém, Brazil, with a stark reality check from UN Secretary-General António Guterres: The world has now passed 1.5 degrees Celsius of average warming above preindustrial temperatures. While climate scientists had begun acknowledging that this trajectory was likely, climate negotiators and diplomats understandably have until now preferred an optimistic outlook on the 2015 Paris Agreement ambition to keep temperatures below 2 degrees of warming. And after a woefully weak final agreement, COP30 also ended with another harsh reality: The cooperative and optimistic era of climate diplomacy, epitomized by the Paris Agreement, has given way to a more fragmented and competitive world, in which climate change is taking a back seat to other concerns.

The current U.S. administration has undoubtedly exemplified this shift. President Trump has called climate change a “con job,” as his administration openly torpedoed the International Maritime Organization negotiations, and COP30 featured no official U.S. government representative. While few countries have gone as far as the United States in rejecting climate action, there’s no denying that ambitions have wavered and political urgency has waned across the board. An overwhelming majority of countries—95 percent—were late with their Nationally Determined Contributions, which were the pledges due at this summit to set ambitions for the next decade. And when they arrived, they added up to well under what’s needed to meet the Paris goals.

Despite this gloomy picture, it’s important to acknowledge that significant progress has been made since Paris. The world was on a trajectory for 4 degrees of warming before 2015. Thanks to the COP process and bold climate action from many partners, we’re now closer to 2.5 to 3 degrees. Shaving off 1 degree matters: The reduction will likely save countless lives and livelihoods in the decades to come. Clean energy investments continue to grow, led largely by China, but also by national-level and private-sector innovation. And despite weak final agreement language on emissions, COP30 attendees agreed on other notable initiatives, including the adoption of adaptation indicators to measure country progress and a call for tripling adaptation finance by 2035. Convening 194 countries to grapple with the most challenging issues facing the world can still achieve progress, even if insufficient.

The outcome of COP30 underscores the growing challenges countries have cooperating in the face of an increasingly complex landscape of state and non-state threats from increasingly visible climate security impacts to economic coercion and hybrid warfare. Against this backdrop, COP negotiators were acutely aware of an environment that now includes the sharpening intersection of geopolitical competition and climate politics; the rising urgency of investment in adaptation to manage the climate security impacts unfolding today; and the need to prepare for growing international attention to more radical climate interventions, such as solar geoengineering, as the world falls short of the 1.5 degree target.

COP30 Reflected a Fragmented World

COP30 underscored how much climate diplomacy can shift in just a couple years. In 2023, a U.S.-China agreement on methane ahead of the United Arab Emirates-led COP28 sent a signal to the rest of the world that the two largest emitters were ready to lead. That COP also saw an agreement to create the Loss and Damage Fund, the first-ever COP commitment to “transition away” from fossil fuels, and 95 countries signed a declaration on the nexus of climate change, conflict, and the need to provide finance in the most fragile states. Fast-forward just two years and the picture from Belém was much different.

For the United States, the Trump administration’s abrupt reversal on U.S. climate leadership—including a withdrawal from key agreements, a rollback of domestic green policies, and dismantling of the agency responsible for adaptation and global development—has left many countries questioning whether Washington remains a reliable partner on climate action. In this vacuum, though it stayed relatively quiet in Belém, China continues to expand its global influence through clean energy finance and technology exports, leveraging its dominance in solar, batteries, and electric vehicles to position itself as an indispensable player in the energy transition.

Absent strong leadership from the U.S. and China, COP30 negotiations sputtered; the final agreement took a step backward by not mentioning fossil fuels and resulting in only minimal new commitments of climate finance. To navigate this new more competitive environment among great powers, developing countries framed issues like climate justice, debt relief, indigenous representation, and finance as sovereignty and security issues. Meanwhile, middle powers aimed to leverage the COP as a platform to elevate themselves and their national industries, with mixed success. Oil-producing Saudi Arabia was able to ensure weak language on emissions, Indonesia used the meeting to sell carbon credits, while host nation Brazil failed to secure much funding for its marquee new fund for forests.

Critically, COP is no longer the only game in town for climate cooperation. With bilateral and minilateral cooperation on some issues thriving, private-sector development continuing to grow, and security interests taking up a larger share of national budgets and policy attention, leaders are coming face-to-face with this climate reality: COPs are becoming arenas for soft-power projection and contestation, rather than problem-solving.

Adapting to the Unavoidable: The 1.5-Degree Reality Check

One bright spot at COP30 was the focus on adaptation, though it remains to be seen whether this emphasis will deliver on the meeting’s ambitious goals in this area. Nonetheless, this year’s COP has been the most forward-leaning on adaptation measures, establishing for the first time a set of adaptation indicators against which countries will be measured. The meeting also emphasized new sources of financing, datasets, and tools to make it easier to shift away from traditional, mitigation-focused efforts.

Global leaders already face a massive adaptation gap: Current funding and planning fall far short of the current scale of need, which continues to spread to new regions and sectors. While fragile states and sectors already face destabilization risks from climate change, the Global North is also increasingly finding itself on the back foot after record droughts, storms, floods, and wildfires. Climate change is impacting global stability, with water, food, and energy insecurity driving migration, conflict, and political unrest.

These factors often exist in an intractable vicious cycle. Examples of this phenomenon include the intersection among rainfall cycles, displacement, and conflict in Somalia; drought and displacement ahead of the 2011 Syrian civil war; and more. Notably, when climate change and security intersect, the effects are rarely limited to national borders. Instead, effects tend to reverberate outward due to increased migration, interrupted supply chains, and potential recruitment for non-state armed groups. Without adequate planning and funding, a localized climate disruption can grow to a national—or even regional—disaster.

Recognizing the challenges ahead, both military and humanitarian actors are preparing for these cascading crises, but they need more funding and emphasis on long-term adaptation planning, not pressure from governments or donors to narrowly focus on mitigation. As demonstrated by the cascading risks of a world rocketing past 1.5 degrees, investment in adaptation is not just good development policy—it’s a strategic necessity.

***

Ultimately, COP30 may mark a shift in global climate cooperation. Unlike the political consensus and goodwill that drove the Paris climate accords in 2015, today’s COPs are yielding little more than political rhetoric and unfunded promises. Going forward, the real action will likely be in national strategies, regional blocs, public-private partnerships, and coalitions of the willing.

Instead of clinging tight to the COP system, the challenge for policymakers will be to manage this shift without letting climate governance fracture entirely. This will require them to embrace today’s climate realities: practicing realism about the limits of mitigation, placing more emphasis on adaptation, recognizing the stability challenges to come, and being pragmatic about the venues for cooperation in today’s geopolitical environment.

"As the financial risks from climate change become clearer, Banque de France (BdF) is developing a toolkit to understand and quantify potential physical risks.

“Awareness of the damages associated with climate change is becoming increasingly entrenched not only among insurers, but also among business leaders and local government officials,” Agnès Bénassy-Quéré, second deputy governor of BdF, wrote in a blog post.

France is prone to flooding and droughts. Météo-France, the official French meteorological administration, estimates that heatwaves will increase in frequency and intensity in the coming decades, with temperatures exceeding 40°C by 2100 and rainfall intensity increasing by 15%.

Climate change is not only changing weather patterns, but is also “having a chronic negative effect on our economies and is becoming increasingly pronounced”, wrote Bénassy-Quéré.

Crop yields in Europe, for example, have stagnated, which can be partly attributed to global warming, according to one study. Businesses have been impacted by increased insurance costs from weather events, while one study shows that climate change could increase the cost of food globally.
BdF response to increased climate risks

The increased physical risks from climate change are one reason why the BdF is developing various macroeconomic methodologies and risk mapping to try and pinpoint the areas of the French economy that are the most vulnerable.

There has been a lot of research by central banks on transition risks in recent years because the modelling is generally easier, but the methodology behind physical risks tends to be more complex.

“The methodological challenge is significant, and so is the data challenge. We have to address them in parallel,” Léopold Gosset, sustainable finance specialist at the BdF’s climate and nature centre, told Green Central Banking.

In a blog post written by Gosset and his colleagues at BdF, the team highlighted the various approaches to quantifying physical risks, as well as the challenges. For example, the European Central Bank’s Eurosystem indicators assume that if 30% of a building is destroyed by a flood then the credit risk exposure would fall by 30%, which is a very simplified approach, said Gosset.

“There is no one-size-fits-all solution for physical risk analysis, because things are way too complex, and every single approach [in] isolation is bound to miss some angles of risk. So that’s why, when you are especially interested in really understanding the transmission channels, you have to model them very specifically,” he said.

At the moment, the most advanced modelling is for floods. BdF has worked with De Nederlandsche Bank on a digital twin project that quantifies the impact of flooding on firms and bank loans. Using detailed information on flood risks, buildings, and loans, the central banks can assess the exposure banks have to physical climate risks through physical assets.

BdF also models for windstorms, heatwaves and perils, as well as events that are unpredictable and harder to understand and estimate, such as wildfires. The central bank also works with the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) – whose secretariat is hosted by BdF – on macroeconomic approaches and climate scenarios.

And while BdF has done a lot of research to understand these physical risks, it’s still continuing to build its methodologies.

“We’re still at the phase of building the methodological toolbox. To that end, international coordination is key, as illustrated by NGFS work or international digital twin projects. The idea is to make methodologies and tools as robust as possible to then, in the future, be able to base decisions on them,” said Gosset.

Still, he says these tools can already be useful in monitoring risk to financial stability, as it gives an idea of the scale of the impact. In stress testing, for example, not only are supervisors doing the work to anticipate risks, but the tests also require banks and insurance firms to also develop their own methodologies.

“Once you have quantified the order of magnitude of the risks, and you have built up the methodologies so nobody can have the excuse that methodologies do not exist, then … it makes it possible to really take the matter seriously, because it’s shown as a material risk that [banks] have there”.
Hiding behind data and measurements

BdF has always been at the forefront of identifying climate risks. France has received the best Green Central Banking Scorecard rating several times in a row thanks to the work of the central bank.

But now that BdF has a lot of data, the question becomes: what to do with it?

Just thinking about exposures and not transition risks at the same time could just exacerbate the problems, as it could lead to banks lending less in areas prone to disasters, said Clarisse Murphy, central banks expert at Reclaim Finance.

“If we don’t actually think about who is responsible for this problem, then we are just going to increase the physical risk of the entire system, and miss the entire point,” she said.

While it’s great that central banks have this data, they shouldn’t get stuck on getting all the data right while not acting on it or just warning market players, Murphy added.

“The market has been very bad at tackling climate change. We should stop waiting [for the market to solve it] and instead have central banks and some of us actually step up to this challenge, and play their role as guarantors of the stability of the system and the financial system, because this is actually their job,” she said.

Romain Svartzman, research fellow at Bocconi University’s Institute for European Policymaking and former BdF senior economist, says that central banks as a whole have been perhaps “hiding a little bit behind ‘let me measure, let me measure’”.

At the same time, while there is a push for central banks to be greener, they can very quickly reach the limits of their available tools.

Central banks themselves won’t be able to solve climate change and coordination is needed with fiscal policy makers, governments and the private sector, a point that Svartzman explored with his former BdF colleagues in The Green Swan several years ago.

“I think that unfortunately, six years later, it seems to confirm a little bit this risk that we’re seeing … of hiding a little bit behind these measurements so that you don’t have to ask an uncomfortable question about ‘how do I coordinate with [other] institutions?’, when you see yourself as an independent institution.”
Macroeconomic impacts

Some of the ways BdF assesses physical risk is very granular and can jump to the impact on financial firms directly rather than considering the broader economic risks, said Pierre Monnin, senior fellow at the Council on Economic Policies.

“What is important, if you want to have a good view of the risks, is to also look at the economic risk. For example, what would the loss of GDP in this region be? How much will wages and unemployment be affected? And then look at how this large economic picture is going to affect the financial sector?”

Banks are also only one part of the financial sector. Losses from catastrophic events like flooding won’t just impact banks, but also insurance firms, as well as public finance consequences. It could also have an impact on supply chains and have a cost to other regions, Monnin added.

One thing Monnin would like to see is for central banks like BdF to use the research on climate risks to encourage banks to help with the transition to a green economy.

“If we have a transition, then we will have a lot less physical risks for banks. So it is in the interest of financial supervisors to move towards the transition, because in this scenario we will have much less losses for the banking sector and thus stronger financial stability,” he said.

One macroprudential tool available to address these risks is to lower capital buffers for banks that invest in the transition, Monnin said.

“Supervisors, especially in Europe, have already asked each bank to do a better job. The next step for them is to implement macroprudential capital buffers to increase loss absorption capacities of the banking sector and to integrate capital incentives to work for the transition in these buffers,” he said.",Climate Change

However, it’s not just extreme heat that negatively affects people. Hotter days overall are to be expected in the future, and these are also being recognised as a background stressor. Globally, 2024 was the hottest year on record, surpassing the previous record set in 2023. It’s clear that things are not cooling down. Adaptation is vital, in order to take care of not just our bodies, but our minds. 

Adults are not the only ones with these worries. The younger generation is facing a multitude of challenges relating to climate change, and we’re already seeing the effects it’s having on their mental health. Climate anxiety and eco-anxiety are on the rise and are particularly affecting young people. A global survey by The Lancet surveyed 10,000 young people, across 10 countries, between the ages of 16-25. 59 per cent said they were very, or extremely worried about climate change, while 84 per cent were at least moderately worried.

More than 50 per cent mentioned having feelings of sadness, anxiety, anger, powerlessness, helplessness, and guilt. 45 per cent said their feelings about climate change ‘negatively affected their daily life and functioning.’ Findings specifically from the UK showed that out of 1,000 children, 50 per cent reported feeling extremely worried about climate change. 

Climate change further highlights the inequalities faced by some children in society. Children from communities that have been marginalised because of race or economic status are more likely to be exposed to extreme weather and have anxiety, sleep troubles or PTSD, according to a 2023 report from APA and ecoAmerica. Is there any good to come of this? In some cases, this worry and anxiety for the planet can turn into positive action, filling people with the determination to actually make change. When our environment supports us, climate anxiety can give us drive and will instead of feelings of powerlessness. It’s why equipping people with the tools and providing access to make a difference is so important. We should be worried for our planet, but how we handle that worry is the real dilemma.  

Studies have found that pro-environmental behaviour correlates with positive well-being. Strengthening support systems, reducing inequality and breaking down barriers for people to take climate friendly action, should be at the forefront of governments and policy makers. ",Climate Change
"he 2025 Atlantic hurricane season ended with a record number of Category 5 storms, signaling new climate-driven extremes ahead, according to researchers at MS Amlin.

“On paper, this year’s Atlantic storm season appeared relatively benign,” said Sam Phibbs, MS Amlin’s head of Catastrophe Research. “The total number of named storms and hurricanes fell below both forecasts and the long-term average. Yet 2025 will be remembered for the unprecedented share of storms reaching high intensities.”

“The impact of climate change on hurricane wind losses in the U.S.” is a peer-reviewed article published in the Journal of Catastrophe Risk and Resilience, analyzing how a two-degree warming scenario could impact future Atlantic hurricane seasons.

Category 4 and 5 hurricanes with winds exceeding 130mph could become more frequent, maintaining strength further north due to warming ocean temperatures, the researchers found.Florida would see the largest projected increase, with insured losses rising by 44 percent.

New York’s insured losses could rise by 64 percent, researchers said, while Rhode Island and Massachusetts could see potential increases of over 70 percent in average annual loss.

The Carolinas may face a 60 percent increase in losses during major storm years, three times higher than the projected increases expected in Texas.

A repeat of the 2022 hurricane season, which cost US$62 billion, could exceed $90 billion in insured losses under the warming scenario.

Phibbs noted that Hurricane Melissa was the most powerful storm ever recorded, with sustained winds reaching 185mph.

“Melissa was not an anomaly but a warning of the supercharged storms we are likely to face more often in a warming world. Its rapid intensification – with winds doubling from 68mph to 139mph in a single day – illustrates how warmer oceans are fuelling hurricane strength in the Atlantic basin,” Phibbs added. “This trend is deeply concerning, particularly as rapid intensification remains difficult to forecast, leaving communities with less time to prepare or evacuate.

A staggering 60 percent of hurricanes hit a Category 5 level, Phibbs said.

“This aligns with projections that climate change is pushing more storms towards extreme intensity, and potentially devastating consequences if they make landfall,” he said.

Despite frequency and intensity, no hurricanes made landfall in the U.S. this year.

Phibbs said this is due to luck, rather than any long-term trend.

“The season should serve as a cautionary tale: our research indicates insured losses from U.S. hurricanes could rise nearly 50 percent under a 2°C global warming scenario,” the research head stated. “Warmer oceans will also enable storms to maintain their terrifying strength further north, threatening cities along the upper East Coast – regions historically less exposed and less prepared.”

The findings suggest compelling reasons for stronger building codes across the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, said Phibbs, bringing standards in line with hurricane-prone states such as Florida and Louisiana.

“Without such measures, the protection gap will widen, leaving more people vulnerable to the catastrophic impact of these storms,” he added. “This season stands as one of the starkest reminders of the risks we now face.”",Climate Change

""This merger must be blocked,"" the Writers Guild of America East and West said in a statement. ""The world’s largest streaming company swallowing one of its biggest competitors is what antitrust laws were designed to prevent.""
The deal faces antitrust reviews in the United States and Europe, and American politicians have already expressed skepticism.
The Writers Guild, which represents writers in motion pictures, television, cable, broadcast news, podcasts and online media, raised concerns over job cuts, wage reductions, higher prices for consumers and worsening conditions for entertainment workers. Netflix said it expects to generate at least $2 billion to $3 billion in annual cost savings by the third year after the deal closes.
The Netflix-Warner Bros deal risks eliminating 25% of the annual domestic box office, said Cinema United, the trade group representing 30,000 movie screens in the United States and 26,000 internationally.
Netflix does release some films in theaters before making them available to subscribers, and the company said it would maintain theatrical releases for Warner Bros films and support Hollywood creative professionals.
Netflix said the deal would give subscribers more shows and films, boost its U.S. production and long-term spending on original content and create more jobs and opportunities for creative talent. Warner Bros Discovery did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment on the opponents' concerns.
But Cinema United President Michael O'Leary called the merger ""an unprecedented threat"" and questioned whether Netflix would maintain the current level of distribution. ""Sporadic and truncated theatrical releases to meet awards criteria in a handful of theaters is not a commitment to exhibition,"" O'Leary said.
The Hollywood Teamsters, who represent drivers, casting professionals, mechanics and other workers in the entertainment industry, also opposed the deal, calling for ""opposition across all levels of government"" while urging antitrust enforcers to reject the deal.
""Teamsters have been clear on our position that greed-fueled consolidation of corporate power, no matter what industry, is a direct threat to good union jobs, the livelihood of our members and the very existence of our industry,"" the union said in a statement.
The Directors Guild of America, however, was more reserved, saying it had significant concerns to discuss with Netflix.
""We will be meeting with Netflix to outline our concerns and better understand their vision for the future of the company. While we undertake this due diligence, we will not be commenting further,"" the DGA said in a statement.
The screen actors union SAG-AFTRA said the merger ""raises many serious questions"" and it would comment further on the impact on its members after analyzing the deal.",Economic Justice
"PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- SEPTA and its largest workers union have reached a contract agreement, preventing a strike that would have halted Philadelphia's mass transit in the middle of the holiday season.

The two-year deal includes an across-the-board 3.5 percent wage increase in each year of the agreement, an increase in pension benefits, and improvements to benefits for new employees.

TWU Local 234 issued a statement Monday afternoon that said it was the involvement of Gov. Josh Shapiro that broke the stalemate and averted a walkout.

As recently as Friday it appeared a strike was all but inevitable, with union leaders saying a strike was ""imminent"" at a late afternoon news conference.

The proposed contract will go to union members for ratification. A vote will be scheduled for later this month.

The deal will then have to be approved by SEPTA's board.

The previous contract expired on November 7. Union members had authorized the union's president to call a strike if no agreement was reached.

A strike would have shut down bus and trolley service, and all service on the Market -Frankford and Broad Street lines.",Economic Justice
"Republican legislators are expected to repeal a controversial bill clamping down on public employee unions when they meet in a special session Tuesday, averting a showdown at the ballot box next year and the potential that voters could hand the Legislature a loss by repealing the measure.

They are also planning to postpone the period for candidates to file for office — giving them time to ask the Utah Supreme Court to throw out a new court-ordered congressional map that creates a Democratic-leaning seat — and to propose a constitutional amendment weakening the citizens’ right to ballot initiatives.

The repeal of the anti-labor law, passed earlier this year, has been debated internally by Republican lawmakers for months and averts what would have been a costly campaign, the potential for being handed an embarrassing defeat by voters and also spiking 2026 voter turnout.

“It’s clear that the heated debate around these issues has created unnecessary division, which was never the intent,” Senate President J. Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said in a joint statement Sunday.

“Repealing the bill allows us to reset the discussion and move forward to ensure we get this right,” they said. “We’re committed to continuing conversations with all stakeholders to craft policies that support our public employees, protect public funds, and keep Utah’s government responsive and accountable to the people we serve.”

Labor groups, who spent nearly $3 million gathering more than a quarter million signatures to repeal the anti-union law in the most successful such effort in history, are supporting the repeal. The group behind the referendum push, Protect Utah Workers, a coalition of 21 labor organizations, issued a statement thanking legislators for “listening to the people.”",Economic Justice
"Republicans want to put the economy at the center of their midterm message as they seek to protect their majorities in Congress. But as cost-of-living concerns mount across the political spectrum, the GOP is struggling to act decisively to address them.

Already top Republicans acknowledge they haven’t done enough to sell the “one big, beautiful bill,” the party-line centerpiece of their economic agenda they enacted over the summer. Now internal divisions and the need for bipartisan support in the Senate are threatening any attempt to follow up on it.

The GOP is struggling to coalesce behind a health care plan that would prevent Obamacare premium hikes set to kick in next month and efforts to rein in President Donald Trump’s tariffs have run aground in the House. Meanwhile, the administration’s proposal to distribute $2,000 rebate checks has gotten a lukewarm response on Capitol Hill and the fate of other smaller bills to address things like housing prices and student debt have sparked intraparty sparring.

“The cost of living is a legitimate issue — I think it was one of the main reasons President Trump was elected. I think it’s still an issue,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said in an interview, urging Republicans to pursue another party-line bill before the midterms in response.

While many in the GOP — including Trump — continue to lay blame for their economic problems with former President Joe Biden, there are clear warning signs for Republicans. Forty-six percent of respondents in a recent POLITICO Poll said the cost of living is the worst they can remember it being.

That includes 37 percent of those who voted for Trump in 2024, and about a quarter of Trump voters say he is either fully or mainly responsible for the current state of the economy.

Yet top GOP leaders in Congress are keeping expectations low for major new economic legislation. Instead, they are betting on having an easier time addressing affordability questions next month, when new programs enacted as part of the megabill start impacting voters — like no taxes on some tips and overtime income.

“We haven’t probably messaged as effectively as we should,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said in an interview, when asked about the party’s economic case. “I think we’ll have lots of opportunities now that we’re getting into an election year to talk about the things we’ve done and how they are going to lead to things being more affordable for the American people, probably starting with tax relief next year.”

Speaker Mike Johnson also argued voters have not fully felt the impact of the megabill “because it takes a while for it to be implemented.” But he predicted that by mid-2026, “there’s going to be boats rising in the economy, this is going to be a very different situation before we go into the election cycle.”

“Republicans are dialed in like a laser, with laser focus on the cost of living and affordability,” he added, while forecasting more to come: “They are going to see this agenda going forward — our affordability agenda.”

But there are reasons to doubt an impending turnaround. Some of these same leaders argued this summer, as they strained to pass the megabill, that Americans would feel the economic benefits in a big way by late fall. That never materialized, with Republicans instead bogged down in a monthslong fight over releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein and a lengthy government shutdown. Trump himself has recently taken to calling the emphasis on affordability a “hoax” perpetrated by Democrats.

Democrats are gearing up to hammer the GOP on the issue, and some of them are hearing some familiar echoes in the promises of a rapid turnaround just around the corner. Democrats said much the same thing after their party passed their own major party-line bills as inflation rose under Biden.

“They are in a bubble from Donald Trump on down,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters last week. “Donald Trump says there’s no affordability crisis — what kind of world is he living in?”

Kennedy isn’t the only one talking up the idea of doing a second party-line bill using the budget reconciliation process to overcome a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. The Republican Study Committee, a large bloc of House conservatives, is pushing such a bill aimed at addressing affordability and other issues, and Senate Budget Chair Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is vowing to plow forward in laying the groundwork for another reconciliation measure.

But Johnson and Thune have treaded lightly on the prospects for second such bill, which faces uphill odds with the GOP divided on the policy particulars and the midterms drawing closer by the day. Instead attention is being drawn to smaller-bore efforts.

Tony Fabrizio, a top Trump pollster, also urged members of the RSC last week to tackle high prices for prescription drugs and housing — warning members in a closed-door meeting that affordability concerns were a key reason a House special election in Tennessee was so close.

But even a push to attach a bipartisan housing package to the annual defense policy bill sparked an intraparty turf war, pitting Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the panel’s ranking member, against House Financial Services Chair French Hill (R-Ark.).

Scott said in an interview last week the housing measure is “a great sign that we are looking for ways to address the challenges that we see in real America” and that passing it now would put lawmakers “on the same page as President Trump and the White House.”

But Hill, who plans to advance a separate housing package through his committee later this month, told senators that parts of the Senate bill are unacceptable to most House Republicans and need to be left out of the Pentagon bill.

Rep. Mike Flood (R-Neb.), who is spearheading the House package, said last week he would be “amenable to something that has provisions the House wants and the Senate wants.” Thune, asked if the Senate housing provision would get in the defense bill, crossed his fingers.

But no agreement could be reached over the weekend, and the House released defense bill text Sunday night that did not include the housing provisions.

Other lawmakers are itching to show that the party is addressing other affordability concerns, even if those efforts face an uncertain path to becoming law.

House GOP leaders, for instance, are trying to move long-delayed permitting reform legislation over the floor in the coming weeks, arguing that reducing red tape for energy and other projects would lower the cost of living. And Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla.) told reporters Thursday there could soon be a bipartisan effort to force a bill capping student loan interest at 2 percent to the House floor.

“That’s a hint for next week,” she said, when asked if she or a colleague would pursue a discharge petition aimed at sidestepping House GOP leaders who have opposed other forms of student loan relief.

House and Senate Republicans, meanwhile, are having a furious behind-the-scenes debate about how to show they are trying to address health care costs ahead of the end-of-year expiration of Obamacare subsidies used by more than 20 million Americans.

Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) acknowledged “there’s a lot more to do” on affordability beyond this year’s megabill on health care and more: “Obviously, medical inflation is very high.”

But GOP leaders in both chambers are scrambling to figure out what pieces of a health care overhaul to put forward — and getting an earful from competing factions within their own party. It’s possible Senate Republicans this week won’t put a consensus GOP alternative up for a vote alongside the three-year extension Democrats want.

A plethora of rank-and-file options are under development, with Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) backing a two-year extension of the subsidies with new eligibility restrictions, Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) wanting to provide more flexibility for health savings accounts and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) proposing to make it easier to deduct medical expenses on their income taxes.

“It’s a disaster,” Hawley said. “Health care, as it currently is, is too expensive for everybody.”",Economic Justice
"WASHINGTON — Congressional Republicans are starting to publicly and privately sound the alarm about their party’s disjointed strategy to address Americans’ affordability concerns, with some growing increasingly frustrated with President Donald Trump’s sometimes cavalier attitude toward the subject.

While Republicans say the high cost of living is a problem they inherited from President Joe Biden, many GOP lawmakers still think their party needs to sharpen its own message and platform ahead of the midterms — or else it could cost them their tenuous majorities in Congress.

“If we don’t do that, we would be morons, because the economy is very much on people’s minds,” Rep. Tony Gonzales, a Texas Republican, told NBC News. Democrats “failed to really hammer the economy, and it cost them the election,” he added. “If we as Republicans fail to do the same, it wouldn’t surprise me if we had a similar turnout.”

Nearly two dozen Republican senators, House members, strategists and congressional aides shared their concerns about their party’s handling of affordability in interviews with NBC News. Another six acknowledged the issue but said the party will settle on the right strategy to address it.

Their comments come after Democrats have secured wins in many of this year’s elections, with voters citing economic concerns, and as Trump has dismissed the issue as a Democratic “hoax,” rhetoric that has privately frustrated some Republicans.Even some of the most MAGA Republicans are calling for a pivot. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said it’s not enough to fix the message: He said Republicans can only improve their standing by delivering real results to lower costs and grow wages.

“People aren’t dumb,” Hawley said. “They know when they go to the grocery store what it costs and what it doesn’t. They know what their rent costs. They know what their prescription drugs cost. And all of that stuff is too high. And they can’t afford it. And they know that. So we’ve got to deliver.”

Some Republicans have voiced their concerns to GOP leaders in private conversations, phone calls and meetings, according to two Republican lawmakers with direct knowledge of the discussions. One of those lawmakers said they also delivered a similar message to White House aides.

And at least one House Republican — Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey — said he directly raised the issue with Trump during a call last week, though they were primarily focused on health care costs, which are set to skyrocket if Congress doesn’t act before the end of this year.

“Dozens of members and senators have been voicing concerns for several months to anyone that will listen,” said a Republican strategist who works with congressional candidates. “Senior White House aides have been a part of many of those discussions. Whether those aides have ever relayed the level of consternation to the president, that’s the unknown.”

Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was one of Trump’s top allies in Congress until recently, has been among the vocal Republicans complaining that Trump has spent too much time on foreign policy and not enough on domestic issues like the cost of living. Her frustrations led to a public falling-out with the president, which prompted her to announce she’ll resign next month.

The public and private warnings come as Republicans have grown increasingly nervous about Trump’s standing and the broader political environment. Trump’s 36% approval rating in the latest Gallup poll, the lowest mark in his second term, alarmed some in the GOP.

“I do think there’s challenges in a midterm year with our party in power,” Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who represents a swing district and is retiring after this term, said in an interview. “It’s always hard. And then, you know, the president’s poll numbers today were 36% in Gallup, and I don’t think our side should ignore that.”

The Gallup poll found Trump’s approval declining significantly among Republicans and independents. Trump’s handling of the economy — long a strength for him — was at just 36% approval, while his handling of health care and the federal budget were at 30% and 31%, respectively. “I think there’s red flags, and our party should take that threat serious,” Bacon said.

The results of a special election in Tennessee this week, where the Republican candidate prevailed by 9 points in a district Trump carried by 22 points just last year, have also fueled the GOP’s anxiety. Multiple voters who spoke with NBC News cited the cost of living as a top concern that drove them to the polls in that race.

“It’s certainly a wake-up call that the Democrats are gonna be ready to go, and we need to pick up our game on the issues that matter,” Rep. Scott DesJarlais, a Tennessee Republican, told NBC News. “It’s always the economy, but health care has been put on the front burner, and we need to address that.”

The Republican candidate in the race, Rep. Matt Van Epps, even acknowledged the issue during his victory speech in Nashville on Tuesday night.

“Together we’ll bring down the cost of living,” he said. “I’m tired of too many Republicans ceding affordability to Democrats.”
Republican leaders urge calm

Republican leaders have sought to calm members by assuring them that Americans will start to feel better about the economy once key provisions from Trump’s tax law fully kick in next year, such as no tax on tips or overtime and an increase for the child tax credit.

Pressed by NBC News on whether Republicans are doing enough to address affordability concerns among Americans, Speaker Mike Johnson said his message to everybody is to “relax.”

“We are exactly on the trajectory of where we’ve always planned to be. Steady at the wheel, everybody, it’s going to be fine,” Johnson said. “Our best days are ahead of us. Americans are going to be feeling a lot better in the early part of next year.”

But one senior House Republican, granted anonymity to share their views more candidly, believes it would be a mistake to rely on their mega law to assuage affordability concerns, arguing “no one in America knows what’s in that bill.”

This lawmaker also complained that Johnson wasted almost two precious months of their majority — time they could have used to pass more cost-of-living bills or find a health care solution — by keeping the House out of session during the government shutdown. The speaker has defended his strategy, arguing it helped keep the pressure on Senate Democrats to fold, which they ultimately did.

“There’s no key kind of strategic messaging about these major wins in the ‘one big, beautiful bill,’” the senior House Republican said. “This is a blown majority.”Trump, meanwhile, has repeatedly called affordability a “hoax,” a “con job” and a “scam” by Democrats, to the consternation of some Republicans. In an interview with NBC News this week, Vice President JD Vance said that Trump “certainly understands that prices got way too high” but that Democrats are blaming his administration for not immediately solving “affordability problems caused by Democrats.”

“The hoax is the idea that it’s our fault and not the Democrats’ fault. And I do think that’s a totally bulls--- narrative,” Vance said. Johnson made a similar point.

A White House official insisted that the president’s policies have bolstered the economy, pointing to fuel standards and lowering drug prices among the policies that show the president’s ongoing commitment to affordability.

But there are signs the White House knows it needs to show more sensitivity to voters’ perceptions about the economy. Next week, Trump will travel to northeast Pennsylvania — in a competitive area of the battleground state — to tout his economic agenda.

“We’re now cleaning up what they still don’t have any actual solutions for,” the White House official said, referring to Democrats. “It’s more of a narrative thing than a substantive thing. With the trip coming up here, it’s more to reiterate or underscore that we’ve been working on this since Day 1. That’s not changing anytime soon.”

On Capitol Hill, House GOP conference Chairwoman Lisa McClain, of Michigan, told Republicans during a closed-door meeting this week that leadership plans to stay laser-focused on passing bills to tackle costs and vowed to stay on message on the issue, according to two GOP sources in the room. Directly following that meeting, she then touted the GOP’s “affordability agenda” during a weekly press conference and highlighted low gas prices.

Republicans also received a presentation during a Republican Study Committee lunch this week from Trump’s pollster, Tony Fabrizio, who advised them to focus on topics like reducing drug prices when talking about health care and to be cognizant of voters’ feelings about the economy, according to attendees.

“Part of the message from Fabrizio is just identifying things that people relate to. They don’t want to hear about frivolous things. They want to hear about what things that affect them,” said Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., who delivered a floor speech on affordability on Thursday.
Changing how voters 'feel'

One of the challenges for Republicans is that while things like gas and egg prices are on the decline, many Americans are still feeling the squeeze from inflation, interest rates and a tightening job market. The Biden administration similarly struggled with whether and how to address voters’ sour perceptions about the economy while some key economic indicators were improving. The reality is, it’s difficult to tell voters how they should feel.

“The economy has to feel better, and feeling better sometimes is subjective,” said Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., who was Trump’s interior secretary in his first term.

Zinke says that in order for that to happen, interest rates need to come down and tariffs need to actually result in trade deals. Trump’s tariffs have contributed to the high prices and been another source of consternation inside the GOP.

Another challenge is that a major piece of Trump’s tax law was just an extension of the current tax rates, meaning voters won’t feel much of a difference. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, thinks his party needs to do a better job reminding voters what would have happened if Republicans hadn’t acted.

“We do need to say that a lot more, and remind people, ‘Do you know you were about to lose thousands of dollars of your paycheck, and we stopped it?’” he told NBC News.

Yet it’s far from clear Republicans have an agenda that can meaningfully ease the pain voters feel — at least in the coming year.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said hopes that prices will come down are misplaced, at least as long as the U.S. keeps adding trillions in debt each year.

“For prices to actually go down — people kind of misinterpret this — we’d have to actually have deflation,” he said. “And what we have is less inflation. So it’s better that prices go up 2% a year than 9%. … But it’s not like slowing down inflation all of a sudden means you go to the grocery store and it's less. It means it’s just not going up as rapidly, which isn’t that satisfying.”

Sen. Jon Husted, R-Ohio, who faces voters next year, cited “permitting reform” first when asked what Congress should do to lower costs. He said that would make it easier to build utility lines and generate energy.

“Things like that, that we have control over, are on the agenda,” he said. “They’re just not yet accomplished, and they need to get accomplished.”

Hawley has pitched his new plan to allow out-of-pocket spending on insurance premiums to be deducted from taxes and to create a $25,000 deduction for medical expenses. He said he’d also like to pursue a cap on prescription drug spending and raise the federal minimum wage, a cause opposed by most Republicans.

Johnson has also promised to hold a vote on a health care proposal before the end of the year. But it’s unclear whether Republicans will be able to get a health care bill to Trump’s desk, especially before Affordable Care Act subsidies expire in January.

If the GOP doesn’t pass an alternative and the ACA tax credits expire — which looks almost certain to happen at this point — that means millions of Americans’ health care premiums will surge next year.

“It is frustrating. It’s a big deal,” Van Drew said, when asked about the prospect of his party letting the ACA subsidies expire. “Affordability, it’s the new buzzword now. And I think the thing that we can do the most immediately right now is the health care issue.”",Economic Justice

Welcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering statewide issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for WeeklyMatters for a Saturday morning digest of the latest news and commentary from the Golden State.

This story is part of California Voices, a commentary forum aiming to broaden our understanding of the state and spotlight Californians directly impacted by policy or its absence. Learn more here.

George Floyd, a Black man who had been detained by Minneapolis police after a store clerk alleged he had used a counterfeit $20 bill, died as Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes, ignoring Floyd’s complaints that he could not breathe.

A video of Floyd’s May 25, 2020 death triggered massive protests throughout the nation and across the globe, energizing the Black Lives Matter movement that had been founded in 2013.

Four months after Floyd’s death, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed three bills to address, he said, “the scourge of racial injustice rooted in the legacy of slavery and systemic racism,” including one authorizing a nine-member task force to study reparations for Black Californians.

 “As a nation, we can only truly thrive when every one of us has the opportunity to thrive,” Newsom declared. “California’s rich diversity is our greatest asset, and we won’t turn away from this moment to make right the discrimination and disadvantages that Black Californians and people of color still face.”

Three years later, in 2023, the task force produced a 1,060-page report that catalogued California’s discriminatory treatment of Black people after its 1850 admission as a state that officially prohibited slavery. The report recommended “appropriate remedies of compensation, rehabilitation, and restitution for African Americans, with a special consideration for African Americans who are descendants of persons enslaved in the United States.

“Compensation should be provided for any economically assessable damage, as appropriate and proportional to the gravity of the violation and the circumstances of each case,” the task force wrote.

The report identified a series of reparations amounts for various purposes, with some estimates amounting to $360,000 for each of the 1.8 million Black Californians deemed to have enslaved ancestors. That would total nearly $650 billion — about twice the state’s annual budget.

News coverage of the eye popping figure put Newsom on the spot. He responded with what political pros call a slow roll — seeming to support something but finding excuses to delay actually doing the something.

California to launch ‘historic’ reparations office as advocates regroup from 5 Newsom vetoes
by Cayla Mihalovich and Wendy Fry	

Initially Newsom said in a statement that “dealing with the legacy of slavery is about much more than cash payments,” but when news media suggested he was backing away from his implied 2020 support of reparations, he issued another statement to the Sacramento Bee:

“The sensationalized framing in pieces published by outlets like Fox News and others is inaccurate. The governor looks forward to reviewing the final report — and all recommendations — when complete.” Newsom’s chief communication advisor, Anthony York, said that the cash payments issue “will be resolved” after Newsom meets with legislative leaders later in the year.

Two years later, the slow roll continues.

Black legislators have submitted many bills to implement pieces of the 2023 report, but without Newsom’s support, none has broached cash reparations, and he has been very selective about which bills he accepts. Last year, he vetoed a bill that would have allowed descendants of slaves seek redress for Black-owned land seized by public agencies.

This year, the Legislature’s Black Caucus introduced 16 bills in its “Road to Repair” agenda. A few made it to Newsom’s desk, and he vetoed five of them. Two he signed give up to $6 million to the state university system to study ways of identifying descendants of slaves and create a Bureau for Descendants of American Slavery to fashion a reparation structure.

Effectively, Newsom’s slow roll protects him from taking any meaningful actions, thus bequeathing reparations to his successor, like his many other unresolved California issues.

From a purely political standpoint it makes perfect sense. Newsom’s governorship is drawing to a close. He obviously wants to become president of the United States, and financial reparations are not popular nationally.",Economic Justice
"We have a housing crisis, as you probably, painfully, know. Wouldn’t you like to have someone to blame for it?

The United States is short 4 million housing units, with a particular dearth of starter homes, moderately priced apartments in low-rises, and family-friendly dwellings. Interest rates are high, which has stifled construction and pushed up the cost of mortgages. As a result, more Americans are renting, and roughly half of those households are spending more than a third of their income on shelter.

This crisis has many causes: restrictive zoning codes, arcane permitting processes, excessive community input, declining construction productivity, expensive labor, and expensive lumber. And, some say, the aggressive entry of private equity into the housing market. Institutional investors have bought up hundreds of thousands of American homes since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, outbidding families and pushing up rents—a trend lamented by everyone from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to J. D. Vance.

Casting private equity as a central villain in the country’s real-estate tragedy makes intuitive sense. Who’s going to win in a bidding war for a three-bedroom in a suburb of Cincinnati: a single-income family with a scrabbled-together 10 percent down payment or a Wall Street LLC offering cash? Still, housing economists and policy analysts have argued that institutional investors have played at most a bit part. Supply constraints began cropping up on the coasts a generation ago, if not earlier, whereas Wall Street started buying up significant numbers of homes only after the Great Recession and especially after the pandemic. Moreover, even if big investors are purchasing thousands of homes, they don’t own significant numbers of homes compared with small-scale landlords and individuals.",Economic Justice
"Tacoma leaders are considering whether or not to roll back eviction bans for affordable housing providers. That's in response to landlords’ claims that tenants across the city have stopped paying their rent. The Tacoma City Council is expected to vote on changing the tenant safeguards on Tuesday.

South Sound landlords have asked the City Council for more freedom to remove people who are causing problems. But local renter advocates say officials are moving to change these protections too quickly.

Earlier this fall, Miriam Barnett was excited to show off the amenities the YWCA of Pierce County provides at the Dorothy Heigh Apartments, its affordable housing. She was serving as the nonprofit’s interim CEO at the time, but has since stepped down from the position.

In a two-bedroom apartment, Barnett pointed out features the next tenants may enjoy: “Lots of windows, really bright rooms” and the “dishwashers, lots of cabinet space, full-size oven.”

The facility is dedicated to serving locals who are dealing with homelessness or domestic violence. It is decorated with art and has a playground. Residents can also admire a view of Commencement Bay from a rooftop seating area.

Barnett takes a lot of pride in the YWCA’s dedication to providing affordable housing. She was one of the driving forces behind the nonprofit opening the 54-unit apartment building in 2021.

“My goal is that when people unlock the door, it’s the most beautiful place they’ve ever lived,” she said. “That’s how you serve people who don’t have the privileges that you have — you provide them with everything that you would want for your family.”

But the YWCA has faced major challenges since local voters passed an initiative in 2023 that created the Landlord Fairness Code Initiative.

The law established a number of sweeping renter protections, which included requiring property owners to notify tenants twice before raising their rent and mandating that landlords must provide relocation assistance to renters if they increase rent by 5% or more.
It also created a cold-weather eviction ban that bars all landlords from evicting people between Nov. 1 and April 1. The Landlord Fairness Code also restricts landlords from evicting families with children during the school year.

This shields tenants from losing their housing for a large swath of the year. According to Barnett, “the unintended consequence of that is people quit paying rent.” For-profit, nonprofit and public housing providers have all said that they are seeing an increase in tenants not paying rent because of the eviction prohibitions.

“We can’t maintain housing if we don’t have the rent. It’s not free housing,” Barnett said. “If we had known this was coming down the pike, we wouldn’t have built the housing.""

The YWCA and other low-income housing providers have joined the Tacoma Housing Authority in calling on city leaders to exempt them from the eviction restrictions. In a written statement, the Tacoma Housing Authority detailed how the loss of this revenue threatened the services these organizations provide.

""If we are forced to continue operating under the Landlord Fairness Code as it currently stands, it will fundamentally alter our ability to build, maintain, and provide affordable housing to those who need it most,"" the news release stated.

There are also concerns that the city’s tenant protections could decrease the availability of market-rate rentals along with low income housing. A recent survey of over 160 Tacoma landlords conducted by a researcher at The Evergreen State College found that the majority are planning to own or operate less rental properties in the next five years, at least in part because of the Landlord Fairness Code.

Since the code was created by a voter initiative, local officials have not been able to change or repeal the law for two years. However, the grace period is set to expire this month. That has spurred Tacoma District 2 City Councilmember Sarah Rumbaugh to lead an effort to try to change the tenant protections.

“I am concerned that we have a community that is forgetting about accountability. And I hate to use that word, but I don’t want children growing up and thinking you don’t have to pay your rent,” she said.The Tacoma City Council is considering a number of proposed amendments to the Landlord Fairness Code, including exempting the Tacoma Housing Authority and nonprofit affordable housing providers from the tenant protections entirely.

Officials are also deciding whether to shorten the cold-weather eviction ban and place an income cap on that safeguard. One proposal before the council would only protect tenants who make 120% or less of the area’s median income, adjusted for family size, from being evicted during winter months. It would also exempt smaller private landlords from the cold-weather eviction restriction.

Some of the proposed amendments would align Tacoma’s cold-weather eviction ban with Seattle renter protections, which are less restrictive for landlords.

Rumbaugh wants to finalize changes to the code before the end of the year, saying that affordable housing providers have waited long enough for something to be done about the problems caused by the tenant protections.

“I want us to do something to help our low-income housing providers stay in business and be able to continue to rent to people who are the highest-risk renters and want to create more low-income housing,” Rumbaugh said.

Renter advocates are worried that Rumbaugh and the council are rushing to change the code before new officials elected in November join the council. In January, Anders Ibsen will become the city’s new mayor and Latasha Palmer will be sworn in as an at-large councilmember.

In a news release, the group Tacoma For All said, “We are urging this ‘lame-duck’ Council to slow down and allow Mayor-Elect Ibsen to convene genuine negotiations with tenants at the table.”

Tacoma For All led the effort to create the Landlord Fairness Code. Its co-director, Tyron Moore, believes these safeguards need to be preserved, especially since the policies help people stay off the street.

“I’m sure our tenant protections hurt the bottom line of landlords, and maybe that falls a little bit harder on smaller landlords,"" he said. “But in the end, when we are talking about very vulnerable sections of our population living paycheck to paycheck, folks facing evictions, yeah, I’m sorry — I’m going to take the side of tenants.” Moore acknowledges the Tacoma Housing Authority and nonprofit housing providers may need some flexibility to remove people who are causing problems. And while he said delaying evictions for a few months can help prevent homelessness, renter protections like those created by the Landlord Fairness Code are limited.

“We need massively greater numbers of affordable housing, of vouchers, of subsidies, but that’s not immediately an offer,” Moore said. “We’re left with sort of a hard set of choices when you reduce the question to, like, ‘How strong of eviction protections should the city of Tacoma have?’”

According to Moore, before councilmembers make any changes to the Landlord Fairness Code, they need to take more time — and make more of an effort to listen to the concerns of local renters.

Under that umbrella are people like Francis Faye Oak, who lives in an aging, market-rate studio apartment with her daughter and two cats. Oak said since the Landlord Fairness Code went into effect, it has given her and her neighbors some peace of mind.

“A lot of people are afraid of their landlords,” she said. “They’re afraid of being kicked out of their homes. They’re afraid of having to go to the hospital and needing to get surgery and not being able to work for a couple of months and not being able to pay rent.”

Oak said the school year eviction restriction in particular gives families with children a fighting chance. Even though she doesn’t live in affordable housing, Oak doesn’t understand why the city council is considering pulling back protections for people who rely on it.

“Should they be easier to evict than me?"" she asked. “No, I don’t think so. At the very base level, these rights should be for all renters.”

Still, Miriam Barnett, the former interim CEO of the YWCA, said that nonprofit and other affordable housing providers need more of a balance between the needs of the landlords and the tenants.

“You can’t just let things go on that are going to harm the [housing] agency,” she said.

According to Barnett, leaving the renter protections the way they are now could result in less low-income housing available for Tacoma residents in the future. ",Economic Justice
"ABBA Women’s Choice in Portland looks like a typical medical office at first glance. On an April afternoon, Executive Director Jenny Pratt opened the door, revealing a modern waiting room with patterned chairs and an array of pamphlets featuring the faces of women. A long hallway led past rooms with exam tables, medical dioramas and sonogram machines.

ABBA’s website describes the center as a “medical certified women’s pregnancy resource center,” and Google Maps describes it as a “women’s health clinic.” Staff provide free pregnancy tests and conduct free ultrasounds, which are read by a doctor licensed in the state of Maine, Pratt said.

When it comes to abortion, ABBA’s website emphasizes making “a fully-informed decision,” presents information about adoption and parenting, and lists six risks of abortion, though it does not note how rare the complications are.

The omission is a nuanced sign that ABBA can operate more loosely than a regular doctor’s office. It is not bound to the same oversight as a primary care office or hospital. It is not licensed as a medical facility by the state of Maine, and it is not beholden to federal privacy requirements that protect patient information. 

Rather, ABBA is one of 11 so-called crisis pregnancy centers in Maine. These nonprofit organizations offer a limited range of services directed toward pregnant women and may make claims about abortion that are not supported by medical studies. They are small and largely run by one or two paid staff members, in addition to volunteers.

But they maintain a medical-looking appearance, belying the fact that they are often connected to national or global religious organizations, and do not perform or refer for abortions. 

For instance, ABBA’s LinkedIn page states it follows guidelines set by those religious organizations and that its staff are certified by the American Association of Christian Counselors. Another crisis pregnancy center in Rockport, called Zoe, A Women’s Center, wrote on its tax form that it provides “biblical counseling” alongside ultrasounds and other classes.

As abortion providers in Maine face major funding cuts, staff from reproductive rights organizations are concerned that more women may turn to crisis pregnancy centers, unaware of what these facilities are.

Representatives from Reproductive Health and Freedom Watch, Maine Family Planning, and Grandmothers for Reproductive Rights also said they fear there is an opening for the Trump administration to redirect money from regulated medical providers to crisis pregnancy centers in Maine, as it did in California in 2019.

Lisa Newcomb, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, said she was not aware of any current conversations to redirect federal government funds to Maine crisis pregnancy centers, but “we are aware of this happening in hostile states.”

In Maine, crisis pregnancy centers play less of a role in reproductive health than in other states, in part because Maine does not fund them. No known federal funds currently flow to them either, according to George Hill, president and CEO of Maine Family Planning, which provides reproductive health care, including abortions. 

At least four crisis pregnancy centers in Maine have received federal funding in the past: a total of $31,253 in Paycheck Protection Program funds during the beginning of the pandemic to cover payroll and rent, according to a ProPublica database.

The amount that went to Maine doesn’t appear to have directly funded services and was a small fraction of overall federal awards. Between 2017 and 2023, the federal government gave $429 million from various pools of money to more than 650 crisis pregnancy centers across the country, according to a recent report by the research and consulting firm Health Management Associates.

What’s more, in 2021, Maine was one of only four states with more abortion providers than crisis pregnancy centers, according to a spatial analysis of facilities nationwide, conducted by the University of Georgia College of Public Health. Support for abortion also remains high in Maine, according to surveys.

But the landscape is shifting, even in states such as Maine where abortion remains legal after the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court case that overturned Roe v. Wade. In July, the Trump administration eliminated Medicaid reimbursements for non-abortion health services at certain providers that also perform abortions.

The legislation prevented these providers, such as Planned Parenthood and Maine Family Planning, from billing Medicaid for primary-care services, an important line of revenue. (Federal funds were already prohibited from paying for abortions in most cases.) 
RELATED STORY:   Abortion funds take on bigger role as access to funding shifts

In turn, Maine Family Planning announced on Oct. 29 that it would end primary care operations at three of its locations, in Houlton, Ellsworth and Presque Isle. Its decision came as two in five hospital birthing units across the state have closed over the last decade. 

Both Hill and Jenifer McKenna, a senior advisor at Reproductive Health and Freedom Watch, said the federal changes will decrease access to Maine’s sexual and reproductive health providers.

“Patients who want to see a provider for comprehensive options counseling may find themselves dealing with a fake clinic that has just one item on its agenda and that is continuing a pregnancy to term,” Hill said.

Patients might be misled because crisis pregnancy centers frequently talk about choice, language typically used by abortion rights advocates. Center directors in Maine pushed back against the assertion that they operate “fake clinics” where staff try to convince women to avoid abortion, instead saying they emphasize options.

“When women come in here, we look at them first. We don’t think, ‘I’m going to save her baby.’ 

That’s not why we’re here. We’re here to educate her, to let her know that there are options. Yes, abortion is an option. We know that. But there’s adoption, there’s parenting, and there’s all these other options. So that’s our mindset,” Pratt said.

Mary Rose Pray, director of the Brunswick-based crisis pregnancy center, Care Net of Midcoast Maine, echoed Pratt. 

“We are not pressuring. This is the thing that gets put out, that you come in here, and we are going to corner you, and if you even mention the ‘a word,’ we’re not letting you out. No, no. It’s a person’s choice. They have to make the choice,” Pray said.

‘Risk to public health’

It was not possible for The Maine Monitor to independently confirm how each center in Maine would respond to a woman facing an unintended pregnancy. Staff from nine of the 11 centers declined to answer questions. 

Some centers may provide appropriate information. Nationally, however, many have misinformed women, forced them to sit through religious programming for baby supplies, declined to provide information or referrals for birth control, and used sonograms to attempt to persuade women to avoid abortion, according to national news reports. They have set up near abortion clinics and college campuses to confuse abortion seekers, and have been widely described as central to the anti-abortion movement.

While some crisis pregnancy centers in Maine refuted that they are anti-abortion, at least eight are affiliated with one or more large, anti-abortion advocacy groups that have powerful legal connections and religious missions. Pratt, for instance, said ABBA is affiliated with the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, based in Virginia. The institute’s website says it “stands up for the most vulnerable among us — the unborn,” and provides legal counsel, education and training to its more than 1,800 members across the country. 

ABBA is also affiliated with Care Net and Heartbeat International. Care Net, based in Virginia, describes itself as a “pro abundant life ministry” with a goal to “save babies from abortion” and “ensure that they and their parents have the abundant life that can only be found in Christ.” On its website, Heartbeat International, based in Ohio, says its vision is to make abortion “unthinkable.” 

Of the 11 known crisis pregnancy centers in Maine, six are affiliated with Heartbeat International, and eight are affiliated with Care Net, with some centers belonging to both, according to a database compiled by the left-leaning organization Reproaction, which argues that all such centers oppose abortion “whether explicitly or implicitly.”

When asked if Care Net of Midcoast Maine must be anti-abortion based on its affiliations, Pray said, “We’re anti-abortion in the way that we don’t offer the abortion pill, but we have accurate information about the abortion pill and the possible side effects.” 

Similarly, Pratt responded, “I would say we talk about all her choices and from a life-affirming place. We don’t do abortions here or refer for abortions, but we talk about abortions from a medical perspective.” 

Talk of a medical perspective conflicts with the fact that ABBA and similar facilities are not regulated as doctor’s offices are. While individual crisis pregnancy centers may provide information that meets medical standards, they are exempt from independent oversight that would evaluate their practices.

There is not even consensus on what to call the centers. In conversations with The Monitor, people called them “pregnancy resource centers,” “unregulated pregnancy centers,” “anti-abortion centers” or “pregnancy help centers,” depending on their views of abortion.

Warnings about them come from different corners. Portland city government describes them as “anti-abortion organizations that intentionally mislead pregnant people with scare tactics and lies” and says they are “a risk to public health.” 

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists emphasizes that abortion is a safe procedure backed up by decades of data. Despite this, crisis pregnancy centers “use false and misleading information, emotional manipulation, and delays” to prevent pregnant people from getting timely care from licensed medical professionals, the member organization for OB-GYNs states on its website.

It also describes how crisis pregnancy centers may assert false risks of abortion, downplay the impact of pregnancy and childbirth on people’s lives and health, advertise their centers online using keywords that make them appear in searches for abortion clinics, and falsely represent their facilities as legitimate health care clinics.

Reproductive rights advocates in Maine fear misleading practices could result in increased harm to patients’ health, especially if those practices are supported by government funds that are redirected from licensed health care facilities. 

Aside from Medicaid cuts, earlier this year the Trump administration also stopped Title X funding from flowing to various health centers across the country, including 63 in Maine, according to KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization. Title X is the federal family planning program that helps cover services such as birth control, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy testing, Pap smears and breast exams for low-income patients. By law the money cannot be used for abortion.

The federal government grants about $2 million each year in Title X funds to Maine Family Planning, which distributes the funds to Planned Parenthood of Northern New England and federally qualified health centers across the state. Last year, Planned Parenthood of Northern New England in Maine served 6,468 Title X patients, or 61 percent of all its patients visiting its health centers in Biddeford, Portland, Sanford and Topsham. 

“The issue for us is of course the potential diversion of Title X funds to fake clinics,” wrote Hill of Maine Family Planning. “This would be catastrophic for our patients.” 

Both Pratt and Pray said they don’t want federal funds. 

“As soon as you start taking government money, the government gets to step in and tell you what to do and what not to do,” said Pray, with Care Net of Midcoast Maine. “The fact that we don’t receive any government funds is actually a good thing.” 

Others are not convinced. Nationwide, “the unregulated pregnancy center industry has been proactively, vigorously vying for these funds,” said McKenna, who is also co-author of “Designed to Deceive,” a study of crisis pregnancy centers in nine states. “They’re not in a passive relationship to what’s happening at the federal level. The concern is that they don’t appear to be even close to qualified or equipped to meet the reproductive health care needs of the enormous low or no-income population.” Others are worried that the lack of privacy protections for women who visit crisis pregnancy centers, especially in states that limit or restrict abortion, could result in their abortion plans being shared with those who would prosecute them.

Heartbeat International — to which six Maine crisis pregnancy centers belong — collects the personal data of people who contact Heartbeat International or local affiliates. That information could include clients’ sexual and reproductive histories, test results and ultrasound photos, according to an investigation by TIME. (Both Pratt and Pray said they don’t use Heartbeat International’s data system.)

Centers may say they keep client information confidential, but they are not subject to the same federal privacy laws — such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA — that health care facilities are.

In other words, they are not under any legal obligation to protect personal information or to “keep it out of the hands of abortion bounty hunters,” wrote seven U.S. senators in a 2022 letter to Heartbeat International, outlining their concerns. Heartbeat International responded to say it maintains the same security standards as hospitals.

Unsupported by science

Some crisis pregnancy centers in Maine publish information on their websites, or provide information in-person, that is unsupported by medical studies. For instance, at least three talk about so-called abortion pill reversals, an experimental process aimed at undoing a medication abortion. 

A medication abortion involves taking two drugs: mifepristone to stop the pregnancy growth, followed by misoprostol to make the uterus contract to expel the fetus. Claims of abortion pill reversals — where high doses of progesterone are given to pregnant people who have taken the first but not the second drug required for a medication abortion — are “unproven and unethical,” according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 

A 2020 clinical study had planned to enroll 40 patients in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to measure the effectiveness of administering progesterone after mifepristone. But it stopped early, with only 12 participants, after three of them were brought to the hospital in ambulances for severe bleeding. Those who start medication abortions with the first drug, but don’t take the second drug, “may be at high risk of significant hemorrhage,” the study concluded.

First Step Pregnancy Resource Center in Bangor does not mention this severe risk. Instead it claims on its website that women just need to act quickly after taking mifepristone “for the abortion pill reversal to be successful.” Its source is not a medical study but an “Abortion Pill Rescue” website made available by Heartbeat International. (First Step did not respond to questions regarding claims that centers distribute misleading information.) 

Neither First Step nor Heartbeat International disclose on their websites that the effects of progesterone on “reversing” an abortion remain unproven. In fact, mifepristone alone doesn’t always cause abortion anyway; some women who take only mifepristone have continued their pregnancies, according to a review published in the reproductive health journal Contraception.

The full effect of this misleading information on women in Maine remains unclear. But Mabel Wadsworth Center, a sexual and reproductive health care facility in Bangor that provides abortions, gets “multiple patients” each year who originally visited the nearby crisis pregnancy center, First Step, in pursuit of medical care and walked away with inaccurate information or no actual treatment, said Aspen Ruhlin, community engagement manager at Mabel Wadsworth. 

For instance, Ruhlin spoke of two patients who, a couple years ago, initially went to First Step and tested positive for sexually transmitted infections, but were not referred for or offered treatment. (First Step did not respond to a question about this assertion; on its website it says it provides both testing and treatment.) 

Ruhlin also said Mabel Wadsworth has cared for patients who originally went to First Step and were told they were too far along to get abortions despite being less than eight weeks into their pregnancies. Maine law allows abortions up to the point of viability, which is when a fetus can survive outside of the uterus — generally around 24 weeks. Physicians may perform abortions after that point when they deem it medically necessary. (First Step did not respond to a question about the assertion that it gave inaccurate information on abortion.)

Ruhlin, along with Cait Vaughan and Elayne Richard of the Maine-based advocacy organization Grandmothers for Reproductive Rights, also said they have heard from people who visited centers in pursuit of free baby supplies and had to sit through religious content before receiving less than one day’s worth of diapers. They did not name which centers.

“They are preying on populations who have less access to traditional health care systems, and maybe less education access around sexual and reproductive health,” said Vaughan, a spokesperson for the group.

As Planned Parenthood and Mabel Wadsworth have faced tightening budgets and recent years of big funding losses, crisis pregnancy centers have largely enjoyed healthy margins, though their budgets are far smaller, according to a review of their tax forms. 

Of all the centers, Resolve Life Center in Waterville had the greatest increase in revenue, which nearly tripled between 2019 and 2023. It allowed the center to spend $50,000 in advertising in 2023 — or 19 percent of its expenses. The center does not disclose on its tax forms where its contributions came from.

Doctors help out

Some doctors in Maine assist crisis pregnancy centers, though the public won’t always know their names. No centers currently list the names of their affiliated doctors publicly, such as on their websites or even their recent tax forms, and they aren’t required to.

Pratt and Pray confirmed that ABBA and Care Net of Midcoast Maine each have a medical director, a Maine-licensed physician who reads their ultrasound results, though they both declined to share the names of the doctors.  

“I don’t want to. It’s so polarized here in the state, unfortunately, to be pro-life,” said Pratt, with ABBA.

Crisis pregnancy centers are largely unregulated, so it is nearly impossible to get independent information about their operations. But there is one way to sometimes tell which doctors are affiliated with them: the federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments database.

Any facility, including a crisis pregnancy center, that tests human samples has to get a CLIA certificate. The person who completes the facility’s application for certification is listed as its lab director, said Floyd Salerno who oversees the CLIA program in Maine. The title does not specify the exact nature of the lab director’s role within the crisis pregnancy center, but it indicates the person has helped in some way. 

In Maine, three crisis pregnancy centers have CLIA certificates. Two of them list doctors as their lab directors. 

One, Dr. Warren Shearer, who works in Pittsfield for Northern Light Health, was listed as the lab director for First Step in Bangor. 

Dr. Garth A. Miller was listed as a lab director for Zoe in Rockport. Miller previously worked for Lincoln Medical Partners in Damariscotta, which is now part of Maine Health, but he is no longer employed by the system, a spokesperson confirmed.

Shearer declined to answer questions about the nature of his work with First Step. First Step’s website states it is “licensed” under a doctor, though it does not specify what it means by “licensed.” It also says an obstetrician or radiologist provides final ultrasound reports but does not name them.

A representative from Zoe confirmed that a male doctor oversees the center from offsite and reviews all ultrasounds, but declined to give the doctor’s name. Neither Miller nor a representative from his new medical center, WhidbeyHealth in Washington, responded to requests for comment. 

The Hope House crisis pregnancy center in Lewiston listed support from Dr. Michael J. Czerkes on its website in April, but his name was removed following questions by The Monitor. Czerkes’ Maine medical license expired in 2023, according to Maine’s licensing board for doctors, and he currently practices in Michigan, according to a spokesperson for OSF Healthcare. In an email, the spokesperson said Czerkes declined a request for an interview.

The Maine Medical Association said it did not “have a perspective to share at this time” on whether doctors should be helping crisis pregnancy centers.

Mentions of doctors enhance the appearance that crisis pregnancy centers are medical clinics, McKenna said.

“When people think of medical clinics, they think they’re regulated, that they operate under health and safety standards, that they’re covered by medical malpractice insurance,” she said. Clients would “not assume that this is a private nonprofit, incorporated as a religious organization. That’s what they more typically are.”",Reproductive Rights

Makary and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have told lawmakers and state attorneys general for months that they are actively conducting a review of mifepristone. But behind the scenes, Makary has told agency officials to delay the safety review, people familiar with the discussions said.

Pushing the closely watched abortion pill study beyond next year’s midterms has the potential to help minimize the role of abortion in the upcoming elections, in which some Republicans are facing tough battles to hold onto their seats. Abortion restrictions popular with the right-wing base don’t necessarily poll well with all voters. A 2024 Pew survey found majorities of moderate or liberal Republicans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases.

Still, a group of Republican lawmakers have been pressing forward with asking health agencies to conduct an abortion pill safety study — despite the fact that many leading medical organizations have long deemed the drug safe. Their goal is to roll back Biden-era policies that made the abortion pill available without an in-person doctor’s visit.

Kennedy and Makary have been publicly saying the study is moving forward. In a Sept. 19 letter to Republican attorneys general, they said “HHS — through the FDA — is conducting its own review of the evidence, including real-world outcomes and evidence, relating to the safety and efficacy of the drug.”

A month later, after the agency approved another generic version of the abortion pill, 17 GOP senators pressed Makary for details about the status of that safety review in a letter dated Oct. 16, expressing concern the agency wasn’t working quickly enough.
At-Home Abortions

The easing of access to the abortion pill came after a long battle in which the reproductive rights community pointed to a large body of evidence shows that the pill is safe enough for women to take at home. A 2013 paper reviewing abortion data for 45,000 women showed just 0.3% of patients who took the pill ended up hospitalized. The study’s authors concluded that abortion by pill is “highly effective and safe.”

Studies the FDA cites in its prescribing information puts the rate of serious side effects at less than 0.5%. The drug is used in nearly two-thirds of US abortions and for miscarriage management, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which estimates that roughly 7.5 million Americans have taken the drug since the FDA first approved it in 2000.

Abortion has been a flash point in state elections since the fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022, with many ballot measures moving to protect access. The issue has often transcended partisan lines: In 2024, millions of voters cast ballots for both Donald Trump and state-level abortion protections. Now, as the 2026 midterm elections approach and states consider new initiatives, Republicans are bracing for renewed scrutiny — and the question remains whether threatened abortion access will shape how voters judge candidates.

Anti-abortion activists have pushed for Makary to roll back the looser, Biden-era rules around mifepristone’s use. A conservative think tank released an opaque analysis of insurance claims in April claiming a higher rate of adverse events for the drug than larger studies had found. Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, cited the data in a May hearing with Kennedy as he pressed the secretary to review safety data related to the drug.

Makary’s agency, which is charged with making sure that food and drugs Americans take are safe, has been consumed

by internal turmoil after several high-profile departures in recent weeks. The division that would lead the safety review for mifepristone has had five directors since the beginning of the year.

"Louisiana’s next surgeon general is a Baton Rouge physician who U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. chose for a panel that’s implementing his anti-vaccine policy recommendations. 

Dr. Evelyn Griffin, a Baton Rouge obstetrician and gynecologist, has also aligned herself with Republican Gov. Jeff Landry’s stances on the COVID-19 vaccine and abortion.

The governor’s office announced Griffin’s appointment Monday. She will replace Dr. Ralph Abraham, the state’s first surgeon general who Kennedy recently picked for the No. 2 post with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

“Dr. Evelyn Griffin embodies the expertise and commitment that the people of Louisiana deserve in a Surgeon General,” Landry said in a statement. “Her clinical experience, her leadership in advancing maternal health, and her dedication to strengthening the doctor-patient relationship make her the exact right choice for this role. With Dr. Griffin stepping in, I’m confident Louisiana is in good hands and headed toward a healthier, stronger future,”.

In late September, Kennedy picked Griffin for the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, making her one of his replacements after he removed all 17 prior members in June. Its new lineup voted Friday to update decades-old guidelines that called for newborns to be vaccinated for hepatitis B at birth. 

Griffin sided with the majority in the 8-3 vote, which will be up to acting CDC director Jim O’Neill to adopt. Its revised policy calls for the vaccine at birth only for children whose mothers test positive for the disease. Otherwise, the first dose is recommended to be delayed until the child is two months old.

During debate over the matter, Griffin made a connection between hepatitis levels in the U.S. and immigration.

“We have had years of illegal immigration, undocumented people coming in from higher endemicity countries,” she said. 

U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, a physician with a specialty in hepatology, criticized the panel’s decision in a social media post and urged O’Neil not to accept the panel’s recommendation.

“As a liver doctor who has treated patients with hepatitis B for decades, this change to the vaccine schedule is a mistake,” Cassidy wrote on X. “The hepatitis B vaccine is safe and effective. The birth dose is a recommendation, NOT a mandate.”

“This will make America sicker,” added Cassidy, who chairs the U.S. Senate health committee and cast the deciding vote earlier this year to approve President Donald Trump’s nomination of Kennedy as health secretary. 

In the same meeting where she voted on hepatitis B vaccine policy revisions, Griffin made a presentation to committee members on the use of aluminum in vaccines as an adjuvant, which is intended to improve their efficacy. Aluminum-based adjuvants are commonly used in childhood immunizations for hepatitis B, the human papilloma virus and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTaP).  

Kennedy has claimed aluminum in vaccines is linked to autism and food allergies, though multiple studies have disputed that claim and shown no harmful accumulation or harmful effects from aluminum adjuvants. They include research published in July that studied more than 1.2 million children in Denmark from 1997-2018.  

Griffin said her presentation was intended to inform members of the advisory committee ahead of the possible formation of a workgroup focused on adjuvants that could make recommendations about their use in vaccines.  

GET THE MORNING HEADLINES.

The December meeting was Griffin’s second as a member of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. At her first meeting in September, she voted with the majority on a resolution to recommend ending the use of a combination vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox given to children before age 4. Instead, the committee suggests doctors administer the MMR and chicken pox vaccines separately. The vote followed a presentation of research that showed a slightly increased chance of fever-related seizures in children who received the four-component vaccine compared with those who received two separate shots.

Griffin previously weighed in on vaccine policy at the state level after former Gov. John Bel Edwards issued an executive order in 2021 that required students 16 and older to provide proof of the COVID-19 vaccine in order to attend school. Landry, who was attorney general at the time, joined anti-vaccine forces to have the order repealed, even though families were allowed to claim exemptions to the rule. 

At an April 2022 legislative hearing on a resolution to repeal Edwards’ order, Griffin told lawmakers “the average kid in Louisiana has a higher chance of getting struck by lightning than dying of COVID,” a claim that vaccine proponents called into question.

In her introductory speech as a new member of the CDC advisory committee in September, Griffin said she had received the COVID-19 vaccine.

“In my clinical practice in obstetrics, I had been part of initiatives for maternal immunization, including diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus,” Griffin said. “And in my overall practice, I feel like, if I was to be given a label, I would call myself pro-informed consent because of medical ethics for discussing risk, benefits and alternatives with the patient.”

Abraham offered a similar informed consent explanation when justifying his decision to forego state health department campaigns to promote and administer the flu vaccine. 

Griffin has also made public statements in support of Louisiana’s abortion ban, considered one of the nation’s strictest, that went into effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022. 

In May 2023, Griffin appeared before the Louisiana House Committee on the Administration of Criminal Justice to oppose a bill that would have removed a 15-year prison term and reduced a $200,000 fine for medical professionals who performed abortions. Some doctors expressed concern the state’s abortion law would result in them facing criminal charges if a colleague did not agree when a pregnancy is medically futile, a requirement to allow an emergency abortion to be performed. The proposal, sponsored by Rep. Aimee Freeman, D-New Orleans, would have allowed a single doctor to decide when an emergency abortion is warranted.     

“Our current law is not penalizing doctors who are administering standard medical care, only those who are intentionally performing abortion,” Griffin told lawmakers, who shelved the Freeman bill without taking a vote. 

Griffin has also collaborated with Louisiana Right to Life, appearing in one of its social media broadcasts to explain the post-Roe landscape for reproductive health care providers. She also joined a dozen other Louisiana doctors in signing a statement “to provide clarity that Louisiana Pro-Life Laws protect physicians’ ability to care for their patients.” The letter addresses what it calls “misinformation” and “false narratives” that have circulated since Roe v. Wade was overturned.

"The Senate is gearing up for a vote on extending expiring Obamacare premium subsidies, but a tense debate over restrictions on taxpayer-funded abortions is proving a major roadblock on the path to a bipartisan healthcare solution. 

Broadly, lawmakers in the upper chamber do not want to see the subsidies expire by the end of the year, given the political ramifications and expected leaps in healthcare premiums that would come should they lapse. 

But Republicans demand that Hyde Amendment protections, which prevent taxpayer dollars from funding abortions, be added to an extension of the subsidies. Senate Democrats view that as a non-starter.

""It’s a sticky situation,"" Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., told Fox News Digital.

The Hyde Amendment was first enacted in 1976, and has routinely been added to funding bills in the years since to ensure that federal dollars don’t prop up abortions. The issue has become a political third rail in the ongoing healthcare debate. 

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., acknowledged that it was a tricky situation and how difficult carving a path forward on extending the subsidies would be. 

""Well, I think dealing with Hyde is a big issue,"" Thune said. ""And so, obviously, for both sides we'll have to figure out how to make that work, and we'll see on that. I don't know the answer.""

The Senate is set to vote on Senate Democrats’ subsidy proposal next week, which comes after Thune’s guarantee that there would be a vote in his bid to end the government shutdown last month.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., unveiled Democrats’ proposal on Thursday, which would largely be a clean extension of the subsidies for three years. Republicans have panned it as unserious, and the legislation is expected to fail. 

""Republicans have spent more time kicking low-income people off health insurance and raising costs for those who stay covered, than on doing anything to lower premiums,"" Schumer said. ""They've riddled their plan with poison pills that would ban abortion nationwide.""

Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., told Fox News Digital that the underlying framework of Obamacare comports with Hyde Amendment restrictions but that Democrats were insisting that the enhanced premium subsidies, which were passed during the COVID-19 pandemic under former President Joe Biden, not be covered by the abortion language, 

""We have never, ever agreed to taxpayer funding of abortions in the Republican Party. We're not going to start now, and they know that,"" he said. ""So it may very well be, unfortunately, that that might be their reason for not wanting to do anything on health care because they think it's a really good midterm election issue."" 

Key negotiators that helped end the shutdown on both sides of the aisle are still trying to find a bipartisan solution, but talks have virtually ground to a halt over issues with the Hyde Amendment protections.

Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, was one of the Senate Democratic caucus members that crossed the aisle to end the shutdown. He told Fox News Digital he wouldn’t comment on the Hyde Amendment back and forth, but he cast a grim outlook on how bipartisan talks were going. 

""I don’t know if progressing is a word I would use,"" King said. ""I would say that they are ongoing, and we'll see if we can find some resolution."" 

The Obamacare subsidies were a driving force behind Senate Democrats’ shutdown posture, and with the public unveiling of their proposal, it has some Senate Republicans wondering what the government shutdown was even for.

Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala, who was one of main figures in building a bipartisan bridge to reopen the government, told Fox News Digital that it was clear Schumer wanted to use healthcare as a ""political issue in an election.""  

""Looking at it that way, I mean that you would care more about making sure that taxpayers have to fund abortions than you do about these subsidies shows you their priorities are clearly, in my opinion, out of whack,"" Britt said.

For now, the only option on the table is Democrats’ proposal. Republicans are still trying to land on what exactly they want to do with the Obamacare issue. Funneling subsidy money into Healthcare Savings Accounts rather than to insurance companies has become a strong contender, but Senate Republicans still haven’t made their play call. 

""I think that, my assumption is, if this is what they’re going to do next week, when it fails, then we will have a serious conversation about a real solution,"" Thune told Fox News Digital. ""We haven’t decided yet exactly what we’re going to do, but what that signals though, evidences, is they’re just not serious.""",Reproductive Rights
"A Cumberland County judge has denied the state’s request for a 500-foot buffer zone between an anti-abortion protester and the Planned Parenthood location in Portland.

Maine is suing John Andrade Jr., a street minister who has spent the last six years loudly protesting across the street from the Planned Parenthood on Congress Street on Fridays. Andrade often uses a microphone to preach and plays loud music from a mobile speaker.

A clinic employee testified last month that Andrade has become so loud that it’s interrupting patient care. Cumberland County Superior Court Justice Darcie McElwee found the employee’s testimony credible and agreed that the state could likely prove at trial that Andrade is violating the Maine Civil Rights Act by disrupting medical services.

In one order Monday, McElwee wrote that the proposed buffer zone “would overburden Defendant’s First Amendment rights,” but agreed to bar him from using any noise-amplifying devices outside Planned Parenthood. If he violates her order, he risks a Class D criminal charge, which could entail up to 364 days in jail.

On Wednesday, McElwee denied Andrade’s request to dismiss the state’s lawsuit, giving him 20 days to file an answer to the state’s allegations.

Judge considers whether to keep street minister 500 feet from Planned Parenthood in Portland	

A spokesperson for the Office of the Maine Attorney General declined to comment Friday on McElwee’s orders.

Andrade said Friday he was grateful McElwee rejected the state’s 500-foot buffer request. He said he wasn’t bothered by the order barring him from using amplification devices near Planned Parenthood, given that he previously told McElwee he plans to stop protesting there.

“I think, to me, it’s almost like a moot point, just because I don’t have intentions of going back there for quite some time, or ever,” Andrade said in an interview Friday. “Being that the Lord has made it very clear I’m to move on from that spot, I’m kind of just like, you know, whatever.”

Prosecutors had asked McElwee for the buffer during a hearing on Nov. 20, arguing it was their only option after two years of Andrade ignoring requests from police to turn down the volume.

The state sued Andrade in August, alleging he was disrupting the safe delivery of health care with his noise. They are seeking civil penalties, which could be financial, and an order keeping Andrade from the clinic. McElwee noted in her latest court order that it would be up to her to determine “the appropriate scope of relief if and when the State has proven its case.”

The clinic’s health care manager testified in court last month that patients and doctors couldn’t hear each other over the sound of Andrade outside and that it was causing patients to exhibit physical signs of distress and delaying their ability to receive important medical advice and treatment.

Lisa Margulies, vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, said in a statement Friday they are “deeply grateful to Attorney General Aaron Frey and local law enforcement” for the case.

“Everyone deserves access to the health care they need, when they need it, free from violence, harassment and intimidation,” she said.

Andrade testified in court last month that he hadn’t intended for his preaching to be disruptive and that any noise heard inside the clinic was “incidental.” McElwee said in her order Monday that she didn’t find this to be credible. She cited previous testimony from Andrade, in which he said he didn’t consider abortion to be a medical service. The judge said Andrade also admitted during the Nov. 20 hearing that he refused to turn down his volume after police told him he was being disruptive.

Andrade is representing himself in court. The American Center for Law and Justice, a religious firm, was previously representing him for free but withdrew from the case Nov. 13.

Andrade said Friday that if the lawsuit “drags on,” he considers it an opportunity to oppose abortion care at Planned Parenthood and spread his religious message.

“My only plans or hopes are really whatever the Lord Jesus Christ wants,” Andrade said. “Every day is a new adventure and this past several months has been nothing short of an adventure. I know he’s got it all under his control.”",Reproductive Rights
"Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Friday offered a defense of his support for transgender rights, addressing an issue that has prompted debate and soul-searching among Democrats, some of whom attribute losses in 2024 to a focus on identity politics.

Republicans, Mr. Biden said in a brief speech, had “weaponized people’s basic identity and turned it into a political football.”

“They’re trying to turn it into something scary, something sinister,” Mr. Biden said. “But folks, it’s not really about anything that’s all that complicated. At its core, it’s about giving every American an opportunity to be treated with the basic decency, dignity and respect they all deserve.”

The former president’s comments came as he accepted an award from the LGBTQ+ Victory Institute, an organization that supports L.G.B.T.Q. people in public office, and as President Trump has made it harder for transgender people to participate in public life. Mr. Biden spoke at the group’s annual conference, a gathering of several hundred L.G.B.T.Q. elected officials and community leaders in Washington.

The organization described Mr. Biden as assembling “the most L.G.B.T.Q.+ inclusive administration in U.S. history.” About 15 percent of Mr. Biden’s appointees identified as L.G.B.T.Q., according to the LGBTQ+ Victory Institute.

Mr. Biden, 83, has kept a relatively low profile since leaving the White House. His office announced in May that he had an aggressive form of prostate cancer and in October that he had completed a round of radiation therapy.

On Friday, he appeared to relish the laughter as he recounted how, in 2012, when he was vice president, he had expressed his support for same-sex marriage on “Meet the Press” before Barack Obama, who was president then, had done so.

“I got myself in a bit of trouble — good trouble,” he said.

Mr. Biden’s support for same-sex marriage came as a reversal from earlier in his career when he voted for measures that blocked federal recognition of same-sex marriages and cut off federal funds to schools that taught the acceptance of homosexuality in the 1990s. Mr. Biden’s more recent position helped push his party to take a stand on the issue.  

His embrace of trans issues followed. In 2018, Mr. Biden wrote the foreword for a memoir by Sarah McBride, who in 2024 became the first openly transgender member of Congress, representing Delaware.

As president, he shored up protections for sexual orientation and gender identity under statutes that govern federally funded health care and education. “We see you,” Mr. Biden told trans students at the time.

    A frustrated Congress pushes the Pentagon to produce its boat strike orders.
    G.O.P. senators push health care options as a vote looms on extending Obamacare subsidies.
    Trump backtracks on releasing the video of a disputed boat strike.

In 2022, he signed the bipartisan Respect for Marriage Act, requiring states to recognize valid marriages from other states. The move came after the Supreme Court overturned a constitutional right to abortion, raising concerns that it would use the same logic to reconsider its decision protecting same-sex marriage.

Evan Low, president and chief executive of the LGBTQ+ Victory Institute, said that Mr. Biden had been “intentional about understanding that a historically marginalized community can participate fully and openly in our democracy.”

Mr. Biden’s support for transgender rights stands in contrast to the Trump administration’s efforts to impose strict limits on transgender people, including requiring that U.S. passports reflect the sex on people’s original birth certificates, a reversal of a decades-old policy. Mr. Trump has called transgender teenagers “mutilated” and barred transgender people from serving in the military, asserting that having a transgender identity is “not consistent with the humility and selflessness required” of people who serve in the U.S. military forces.

Mr. Trump has appointed a number of openly gay men to work in or alongside his administration. But he has sought to rescind federally funded programs aimed at ensuring that L.G.B.T.Q. groups receive equal access to education, health care and public accommodations, and to cut H.I.V. vaccine research and funding for L.G.B.T.Q. suicide prevention services.

Those policies have won support from Mr. Trump’s base, as well as from others across the political spectrum. Polls show substantial public support for putting in place restrictions on the transgender rights that the Biden administration had supported. Some Democratic officials and strategists have argued that the party should align itself with public opinion on issues like transgender athletes in sports and medical transition for minors.

But others have suggested that Republican efforts to invoke transgender issues to portray Democrats as out of touch with the mainstream — most famously with Mr. Trump’s 2024 campaign ad tagline “Kamala Harris is for they/them, President Trump is for you” — appeared less effective more recently. For instance, in last month’s race for governor of Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, won despite a focus by her Republican opponent on anti-transgender messaging.

Mr. Biden on Friday said that “because of our national debate” on L.G.B.T.Q. issues, “there are young people sitting alone as I speak, scrolling through social media, wondering whether they will ever truly be accepted for who they are.”

“You are heard, and you belong,” Mr. Biden added, to a standing ovation. ",LGBTQIA+
"The US Department of Justice has moved to eliminate rules protecting LGBTQ+ people from sexual abuse in prisons, a shift advocates say is “reckless and dangerous” and will lead to increased assaults behind bars.

A justice department memo issued on Tuesday said “effective immediately”, prisons and jails will no longer be held responsible for violations of standards meant to shield LGBTQ+ people from harassment, abuse and rape. It also directed inspectors to stop auditing facilities for compliance with those protections. The justice department is in the process of seeking formal updates to the rules, the memo said.

The directive relates to regulations under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (Prea), a longstanding federal law which says incarcerated people should be screened for their risk of facing sexual assault when officials place them in housing and that assessments must consider LGBTQ+ status.

Prea, passed unanimously by Congress in 2003, includes standards aimed at addressing the high levels of violence that transgender, gender-nonconforming and queer people face in jails and prisons across the US. Prea applies to all correctional facilities.

The memo from Tammie Gregg, principal deputy director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance, which is part of the justice department, said the policy shifts were designed to align with one of Donald Trump’s signature anti-trans executive orders. The “restoring biological truth” order, issued on Trump’s inauguration day, called for transgender women to be banned from women’s housing in correctional facilities and dictated that the federal Bureau of Prisons stop providing gender-affirming care to incarcerated trans people.

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Gregg’s memo was sent to Prea auditors, who review compliance with the law, directing the monitors to ignore LGBTQ+ protections in future audits. The justice department, Gregg said, was “currently updating” its Prea standards to align with the president’s order.

The affected regulations, the memo says, include policies mandating that trans, intersex and gender-nonconforming people be “screened for risk of victimization”. It also affects regulations designed to protect LGBTQ+ people from discriminatory pat searches by staff, including rules meant to ensure trans women can be searched by female officers and regulations to prevent invasive examinations of individuals’ genitals.

The memo further affects rules on how employees should respectfully communicate with LGBTQ+ people and requirements that sexual abuse investigations consider whether a perpetrator was motivated by a victim’s LGBTQ+ status.

“The proposed revisions to the Prea standards will lead to increased chaos and violence inside prisons and jails, placing staff and incarcerated people in greater danger,” said Linda McFarlane, executive director of Just Detention International, a human rights group, in a statement. “It will allow rapists to act with impunity. And it is already sowing confusion among prison leaders, who have worked for more than a decade to put in place commonsense rules to end prisoner rape … It’s sickening.”

McFarlane’s group has long trained correctional staff on Prea standards and has had certified auditors on staff. In an interview on Friday, she said the immediate impact was a loss of a critical oversight mechanism, and that she hoped institutions would continue to honor Prea.

Incarcerated trans people have long struggled with abuse, even with the standards in effect, she added: “They are already in grave danger. I’ve never met a trans person in detention who has not experienced sexual abuse or harassment while incarcerated.”

The memo comes even after Trump’s executive order has been blocked in court. Earlier this year, some trans women imprisoned by the Bureau of Prisons were moved from women’s facilities into men’s prisons, but the courts later ordered they be transferred back. The rulings have protected individual plaintiffs, but the majority of trans people in federal custody remain housed in facilities that do not match their gender identity.

Spokespeople for the White House and Bureau of Prisons declined to comment.

Kara Janssen, an attorney who has represented trans women in Bureau of Prisons custody in litigation this year, condemned the memo. “This is putting not only our clients in an incredibly dangerous situation, it’s putting all these facilities in an almost impossible position, with the federal government telling them not to comply with their own laws,” she said. “It’s saying you don’t have to be afraid to violate the law … and you can do these searches as disrespectfully as possible.”

Regardless of any changes to Prea, constitutional protections against cruel and unusual punishment remained in effect, Janssen added: “When people are assaulted as a result of these changes, there is liability for these facilities. That is not going away.”

Shana Knizhnik, senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s LGBTQ & HIV project, noted the memo would create challenges for Prea monitors, with at least one auditor warning in a statement to NPR the memo would make their work “more confusing and more difficult”.

Knizhnik emphasized that Prea remained the law and institutions were required to follow it, but she was concerned about “the signal this sends to officials in charge of maintaining folks’ safety in custody”. She added: “This gives more license to individuals to target trans, intersex and other LGBTQ+ folks in carceral settings and ignore their obligations under the law.”

Knizhnik, who has also represented incarcerated trans people challenging BOP policies, continued: “It’s so important for folks to know that even though the government is denying their existence and trying to put them in harm’s way, there are folks on the outside who care and affirm and want to protect them.”",LGBTQIA+
"It’s easy to feel like Trump and the anti-trans movement are one and the same. He’s certainly pushed forward plenty of anti-trans talking points through his campaign ads, executive orders, stacking of the Supreme Court, and pressure on legislatures.

But while he’s certainly become a figurehead for the movement in some ways, it seems it’s not something he truly cares about on its own merits. And when he’s gone, the anti-trans movement will still remain, and they won’t be as powerless without him as we might hope: Other countries are already showing us how this might play out. The anti-trans movement rose alongside Trump, and he certainly used it to his own ends: He has used it as a distraction from other issues and to drive his cult. He has done massive damage using it, but he never created or defined the anti-trans movement. Anti-trans bills started being proposed in legislatures in 2015, with just 19 bills the year before Trump won his first election, to 1,012 bills this year.

When Trump leaves office —a third term isn’t truly likely, and his health might not see him to the end of his current term — some of the anti-trans measures will likely fall away. When Biden took office, he reversed Trump’s first trans military ban, and that will likely be the fate of the current ban under the next Democratic president. Other things, especially those based on Supreme Court rulings, will likely take longer to shift. But expecting all of that to happen overnight, or without a fight, would be to ignore the true nature of Trump’s anti-trans agenda. It’s not something he’s pushing because he has any genuine feelings about girls sports, but because he is enabling those who stand behind or around him to move their own needles.

We’ve seen his willingness to follow the lead of someone like Russ Vought, one of the authors of Project 2025, when it comes to massive government budget matters. Alliance Defending Freedom and the Heritage Foundation have been behind a huge number of anti-trans bills, messaging, and the general rhetoric that has done so much harm to our community. The organizations and individuals who are behind these bills are true believers in their cause — that is, it’s not 100% political strategy. And while Trump leaving will be a challenge for them, they won’t be going anywhere.

For an idea of just how much of this anti-trans hate is going to stick around — not just in impotent rage but in very real harm — we can look overseas, especially to Britain. One of the United Kingdom’s leading exports to the United States over the past few years has been its transphobia. (Maybe Trump could put a tariff on it, then people might stop buying it?)

The UK’s anti-trans wave ranges from J.K. Rowling’s hate and popularizing hiding anti-trans attacks under the guise of defending women and lesbians, to the now-infamous Cass Review, which as been used as the basis for gender-affirming care bans in the U.S. and was mimicked by the Health and Human Services report in May, which cited Cass 149 times.

The UK’s Conservative Party was in power from 2010 to 2024. Like Trump, they presided over the rise of anti-trans rhetoric, and were campaigning on excluding trans people from public life in the election they eventually lost. It was under their government that the Cass Review was commissioned. The new Labour government, which has more recently taken power, has been weak on supporting the trans community, but has also been less obviously anti-trans.

Despite that, there has been massive damage to the community during the conservatives’ relatively short tenure. The UK Supreme Court ruled that the country’s 2010 Equality Act was based on “biological sex,” and that public women’s spaces and political quotas for women were not for trans women. The UK’s Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) then put out guidance suggesting the exclusion of trans people from single-gender spaces. A leaked proposed update to that guidance would’ve advised business owners to ban people from single-sex spaces based on appearance.

This week, both the Girl Guides (the British version of Girl Scouts) and the Women’s Institute (a women’s organization that has allowed trans women for over 40 years) have now banned trans women and girls from membership. While both groups have indicated they regret having to make the decision, they have said it is necessary to comply with EHRC and avoid legal battles.

It was revealed in November that the Guides have been facing legal action from a parent over their inclusion of trans girls. The parent’s lawyer said “Girlguiding cannot simultaneously rely on an exemption that allows it to provide a female-only association and charity under the Equality Act, while redefining ‘girl’ and ‘woman’ to include biological males. This is legally and linguistically incoherent. It is unlawful and should be immediately withdrawn.”

But while all of this has taken place under the Labour government, it wasn’t because they were pushing for it. The case that went to the Supreme Court was made by For Women Scotland, and it received over a third of its legal funding from the noted transphobe JK Rowling. Similarly, the lawsuit against the Girl Guides is reportedly supported by Maya Forstater, an ally of Rowling who went to court claiming that her “gender critical” beliefs were a protected class that she couldn’t be fired over.

The UK’s anti-trans movement isn’t driven by politics, the leading party, or the prime minister. It’s driven by money and hate. The UK hasn’t been saved by having a politician who doesn’t hate, but it might be doomed by a party that won’t push to institute protections for the trans community.

For trans people to survive in the United States, we don’t just need to be rid of Donald Trump: He won’t take the anti-trans movement away with him when he departs. We need to be rid of the middle ground politicians who want to sit on the fence while trans lives are in jeopardy. We need leaders who will establish strong, real protections in the law.

That doesn’t seem likely under our current political system and with Democrats who want to waiver on trans sports issues because they worry it will alienate hard right voters. We need to see a wider cultural shift to understand and accept trans people, which will require greater representation in media, politics, and the world at large.",LGBTQIA+

"The debate over what content is appropriate for children has ignited at a Zionsville library after a resident petition sought to limit the accessibility of books and participation in LGBTQ-inclusive events.

A newly created Christian men's group filed a broad petition last month in an effort to protect children and teens from ""content that blurs moral boundaries or exposes children to adult themes.""

The Hussey-Mayfield Memorial Public Library heard the petition — as well as a counter-petition — at a Nov. 21 board meeting that drew a couple of hundred people, largely rebuking the effort to restrict LGBTQ books and block any Pride events or drag story times.

""By moving books to places that they shouldn't be, like putting them in adult sections when they're clearly kids' books, is shaming kids and people that relate to the characters in these books,"" Zionsville Pride Leader Aubrey Able said. ""It's a way to try to make these things taboo again when there are families down the street that have two moms.""

The petitions rekindle a ""culture war"" issue locally. Republican-led states have seen waves of book banning and restricting efforts over the last four years as lawmakers passed legislation making it easier to do so.

Indiana hasn't seen as many book challenges as other states. Most notably, Fishers' Hamilton East Public Library was the subject of community uproar and national attention after its board passed a now-rescinded book relocation and removal policy in 2022. Christian group says LGBTQ inclusion harms children

After the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, resident David Story said, he was inspired to organize Men of Truth USA, which he describes as a group of local religious men who ""want to see that truth be proclaimed in our communities and to restore those biblical values that our nation was founded upon.""

In their first major public action, Story and Men for Truth USA petitioned the library to limit materials with ""explicit sexual content or LGBTQ ideology"" to adult sections only, commit to never hosting a drag story time event, and cease sponsoring or participating in events containing adult or LGBTQ content.

The petition had nearly 250 signatures when it was submitted, Story said. The group also had a public petition on change.org, he said, but it was taken down after being flagged as hateful.

According to the library's catalog, its children's, tween and teen sections offer dozens of LGBTQ books, ranging from LGBTQ history and biographies to fictional stories and advice. He and other petitioners have not compiled a list of books they consider inappropriate.

In their petition, Story and his group also condemn the library's involvement in the Zionsville Pride Festival in August. Similar to other community events, the library brought its bookmobile to the festival's kids zone. It also participated in a ""rainbow,"" or inclusive story time.

Zionsville Pride also hosted a drag story time, but the library was not involved in this activity. Able said she doesn't believe the library has ever held drag story times.

Story stressed that he feels his petition has been misunderstood and that they are not attempting to ban LGBTQ inclusion or books. He said they don't want to expose children to ""confusing ideology.""

""If there was anything that I could say to the other side directly, the first thing I would say is, 'We love you,'"" he said. ""One of the most loving things a person can do is to tell the truth to someone who's being lied to.""
The place of religion in government

The First Amendment's establishment clause has long been interpreted to mean government is required to maintain a separation between church and state. However, in line with a growing movement, Story and his petition push back against this as a constitutional concept.

The petitioners claim that the library is ""accountable to God and to the moral standards that have sustained our nation since its founding,"" as well as being accountable to taxpayers.

""Why are we promoting an event where a drag queen reads stories to 6-, 7- and 8-year-olds? Is this something that is promoting what is good, right and true?"" he asked. IndyStar could not find evidence that the library has ever hosted or participated in a drag story time event.

Able disagrees. She argues that the separation of church and state is required at a public institution like the library, and it has no responsibility to uphold the values of Christianity or any other religion.

""Just that's not what the library is about,"" she said. ""The library is about providing information of all types to all kinds of people, and that access of information is important.""
Zionsville Pride calls out petition as 'rage bait'

The idea that the petition seeks to protect children is a Trojan horse, Able said. Instead, she believes, the group is pushing an agenda to limit LGBTQ representation because they disagree on religious grounds.

She said their claims painted an uncharacteristic and untruthful image of the library and were in bad faith. For example, Able said one person compared a book with LGBTQ representation to picking up a loaded gun.

""It's not as if they have books about sexual intercourse or something sitting on the table next to a 'Goodnight Moon,'"" Able said.

Zionsville Pride filed a counter-petition, reiterating LGBTQ acceptance. The petition saw significant support during the November meeting's public comment period and has racked up about 3,900 signatures online.
What's next?

Executive Director Kristin Shelley said in a statement that the petitions are going through a similar process as a book reconsideration request, and the board has 90 days to respond. The board's next meeting is on Dec. 18.

""The Board and staff believe that the right to read and view is an important part of the intellectual freedom that is basic to democracy,"" its policy reads. ""All public libraries contain materials that some patrons may find objectionable. ... Library staff does not serve in (the place of a parent).""

As for what the Story's group does next, he said their focus isn't on libraries, but rather ""how can we proclaim the truth of God and the ways that it needs to be heard and the ways that it's being opposed or suppressed.""",LGBTQIA+
"Authorities monitor online criticism of New Orleans immigration crackdown

Officials track public sentiment, noting negative impact of ‘videos with sounds of children crying’ as parents arrested
Associated Press
Mon 8 Dec 2025 08.19 EST

State and federal authorities are closely tracking online criticism and protests against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in New Orleans, monitoring message boards around the clock for threats to agents while compiling regular updates on public “sentiment” surrounding the arrests, according to law enforcement records reviewed by the Associated Press.

The intelligence gathering comes even as officials have released few details about the first arrests made last week as part of “Catahoula Crunch”, prompting calls for greater transparency from local officials who say they have been kept in the dark about virtually every aspect of the operation.

“Online opinions still remain mixed, with some supporting the operations while others are against them,” said a briefing circulated early on Sunday to law enforcement officials. Earlier bulletins noted “a combination of groups urging the public to record ICE and Border Patrol” as well as “additional locations where agents can find immigrants”.

Immigration authorities have insisted the sweeps are targeted at “criminal illegal aliens”. But the law enforcement records detail criminal histories for less than a third of the 38 people arrested in the first two days of the operation.

Local leaders told the AP those numbers – which law enforcement officials were admonished not to distribute to the media – undermined the stated aim of the roundup. They also expressed concern that the online surveillance could chill free speech as authorities threaten to charge anyone interfering with immigration enforcement.

“It confirms what we already knew – this was not about public safety, it’s about stoking chaos and fear and terrorizing communities,” said the Louisiana state senator Royce Duplessis, a Democrat who represents New Orleans. “It’s furthering a sick narrative of stereotypes that immigrants are violent.”

The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not respond to questions about the intelligence gathering and referred the AP to a prior news release touting “dozens of arrests”. The agency has not released an accounting of the detainees taken into custody or their criminal histories.

The DHS has publicly detailed only six arrests stemming from the operation – all people with criminal histories – including a man they vaguely said was convicted of “homicide” and another convicted of sexual assault. The agency, which has several hundred agents on the ground in south-east Louisiana, has said it aims to make at least 5,000 arrests in the region over an operation expected to last up to two months.

“Americans should be able to live without fear of violent criminal illegal aliens harming them, their families or their neighbors,” the DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, said.

DHS and Republican leaders have framed the crackdown as targeting the most violent offenders. But the records reviewed by the AP identify only nine of the 38 people arrested in the first days as having criminal histories that rose beyond traffic violations – information the intelligence bulletins warn “should not be distributed to the media”.

The New Orleans city council president, JP Morrell, said the stated goals of the operation to arrest violent offenders did not align with the reality of what is taking place.

“There’s literally no information being given to the city of New Orleans whatsoever,” Morrell said. “If the goal was for them to come here and augment existing law enforcement, to pursue violent criminals or people with extensive criminal histories, why wouldn’t you be more transparent about who you’ve arrested and why?”

Morrell and other officials have said the crackdown appears to be a dragnet focused on people with brown skin, citing viral videos of encounters such as masked agents chasing a 22-year-old US citizen returning home from the grocery store.

Law enforcement officials have been carefully tracking such footage and public reaction. “For some supporters, the videos with sounds of children crying in the background as their parents are placed under arrest, is weighing heavy on their hearts,” one briefing stated.

The records also shed new light on cooperation among state and federal authorities in an operation welcomed by Louisiana’s Republican governor, Jeff Landry. Both the FBI and Customs and Border Protection (CPB) have stationed agents at the Louisiana State Analytical and Fusion Exchange, an intelligence and data sharing center that is closely following discussions on the online forum Reddit that local residents have used to exchange information about the immigration raids.

One briefing noted that some “have gone so far as to accuse agents of racially profiling Hispanic areas specifically”. Another flagged social media posts suggesting agents “are not keeping with the mission of targeting criminal immigrants only”. And a third pointed out that critics of the raids “bring up past hurricanes and the work done by immigrants” in their aftermath.

“The chatter is slower during the night, mainly just commenting on posts from earlier in the day,” one of the briefings states. “Once daylight arrives and agencies are back out, the chatter and new posts will pick back up.”",Immigration
"Several immigrants ready to take their citizenship oaths at Boston’s Faneuil Hall in the last week were told they could not proceed because of their countries of origin.

The same situation is playing out across the country.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has instructed its employees to halt immigration pathways to people from 19 countries deemed high risk, including Afghanistan, Cuba, Venezuela, Haiti and Somalia.

The naturalization ceremony is the final step to becoming a U.S. citizen, a process that takes years to complete.

The Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition (MIRA) said Monday that five people they have been working with received cancellation notices, and another 40 people are now uncertain of their future.

“At least 45 people MIRA has been supporting for months as they navigate the complicated and extensive American immigration and naturalization system have been impacted by these latest abrupt changes by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Five of those individuals found out last week that, after extensive vetting, interviews and tests, their oath of citizenship at historic Faneuil Hall had been cancelled while at least 40 who had begun the process now face further uncertainty and delay. This decision and the process is as crass as it is cruel and arbitrary. People are disheartened, devastated and rightly outraged,"" MIRA Executive Director Elizabeth Sweet said in a statement.

Most of those getting cancellation notices are from the 19 countries included in the current ban.

Several people said they received cancellation notices through an online portal, but said the notices provided no further guidance. Project Citizenship, which said some of its clients were impacted, provided an example of a cancellation letter.

Advocates say these cancellations have been going out on a rolling basis, but not everyone is getting the memo and some are finding out as they show up at the door of their ceremony. Gail Breslow, the executive director at Project Citizenship, said a client of hers who has lived in the U.S. for more than 20 years was told on Thursday when she showed up for her ceremony that she wouldn't become a citizen.

“She’s devastated and she’s also anxious, as are many of our clients who have been affected in this way,"" Breslow said.

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu expressed outrage at the situation over the weekend.

“It’s despicable and it is deeply painful to see this happening across the country but to feel it at the 'cradle of liberty' in Boston at Faneuil Hall a place that represents the foundation of this country and the very values that have made our nation who we are,” Wu said.

The process to become a U.S. citizen typically takes between three to five years and requires an application, an interview and a test, plus hundreds of dollars in fees.

“It’s a way for people not only to be able to walk the streets freely, but to be able to travel freely. It also confers the right to vote the right to petition for the family members to come,"" Breslow explained.

USCIS has said this immigration pause is part of an effort to strengthen its screening processes and keep criminals from entering the U.S.

“We changed that approach on day one of the Trump administration. Under President Trump, we are building more protective measures that ensure fraud, deception, and threats do not breach the integrity of our immigration system,"" USCIS Director Joseph B. Edlow wrote Friday in a press release announcing a new screening center headquartered in Atlanta.

"Dec 2 (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday said it paused all immigration applications, including green card and U.S. citizenship processing, filed by immigrants from 19 non-European countries, citing concerns over national security and public safety.
The pause applies to people from 19 countries that were already subjected to a partial travel ban in June, placing further restrictions on immigration - a core feature of U.S. President Donald Trump's political platform.

The list of countries includes Afghanistan and Somalia.
The official memorandum outlining the new policy cites the attack on U.S. National Guard members in Washington last week in which an Afghan man has been arrested as a suspect. One member of the National Guard was killed and another was critically wounded in the shooting.
Trump has also stepped up rhetoric against Somalis in recent days, calling them “garbage” and saying “we don’t want them in our country.”

Since returning to office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritized immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major U.S. cities and turning away asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border. His administration has frequently highlighted the deportation push but until now it has put less emphasis on efforts to reshape legal immigration.
The flurry of promised restrictions since the attack on National Guard members suggests an increased focus on legal immigration framed around protecting national security and casting blame on former President Joe Biden for his policies.
The list of countries targeted in Wednesday's memorandum includes Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, which were subjected to the most severe immigration restrictions in June, including a full suspension on entries with a few exceptions.
Others on the list of 19 countries, which were subjected to partial restrictions in June, are Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.
The new policy places a hold on pending applications and mandates that all immigrants from the list of countries ""undergo a thorough re-review process, including a potential interview and, if necessary, a re-interview, to fully assess all national security and public safety threats.""
The memorandum cited several recent crimes suspected to have been committed by immigrants, including the National Guard attack.

"The Louisville police chief wants to know if an officer improperly gave federal agents his login credentials for the city’s license plate surveillance database.

Public records offer new details about a Louisville Metro Police investigation into whether an officer used the city’s license plate reader network to aid federal immigration enforcement.

LMPD opened the inquiry into officer Wesley Troutman after the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting found he listed a keyword related to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as the reason for more than 100 searches he ran on the city’s license plate reader database.

KyCIR obtained public records that show LMPD Chief Paul Humphrey ordered the department’s Professional Standards Unit to launch the investigation on Halloween — four days after KyCIR informed LMPD of its findings and requested a comment for the resulting article.

The article published on Nov. 3. That same day, records obtained last week show Humphrey directed the Professional Standards Unit to expand the internal investigation on Troutman “to include whether he improperly shared his login credentials to LMPD’s FLOCK database with members of the DEA or others.”

An LMPD spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment for this report.

KyCIR uncovered Troutman’s searches of surveillance data collected by license plate reader cameras after obtaining and analyzing audits that recorded every search of LMPD’s database between March 2022 and July 2025. KyCIR's review revealed Troutman listed “ERO” – an acronym used by ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, the unit that manages immigrant arrests and deportations – for 123 searches in March 2025.

The searches were made shortly before U.S. officials, including an agent with the DEA’s Louisville Field Division, announced they’d arrested 81 immigrants in Kentucky. That operation was “coordinated out of Louisville” and was part of President Donald Trump’s “Operation Take Back America,” a core component of the Republican’s aggressive efforts to deport millions of people.

LMPD’s array of license plate reader cameras photograph cars on local streets and come from the company Flock Safety, which lets police nationwide share access to data gathered in their respective communities.

News reporting, first by 404 Media and then by other news outlets, found some local and state police assisted ICE by running Flock searches for them or by granting federal agents direct access to their databases.

For example, Richmond, Virginia’s police department said this summer that a now-former employee granted access to their Flock network to an analyst with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, who then used that access to make “queries for immigration enforcement.”
Local lawmakers react

Louisville Metro Council Member JP Lyninger, a District 6 Democrat, has said he thinks Troutman’s searches violate a city ordinance that restricts how LMPD can assist ICE.

If LMPD’s internal investigation determines Troutman did share his login information for the city’s license plate reader data with anyone else, Lyninger said he’d consider that “a grievous breach of public trust.”

“Flock cameras amount to warrantless surveillance of people of Louisville,” he said. “We have to have tight controls and to know who is accessing that data to make sure that it's not misused.”

Louisville Metro Council Member Anthony Piagentini, a District 19 Republican and minority caucus chair, said he doesn’t think the city ordinance prevents LMPD from sharing technology with ICE or any other federal agencies.

It’s common for local police to share information and technology with federal law enforcement, he said. But it should be done in a way that makes it clear who’s using the technology, rather than using someone else’s login as a surrogate.

“That gets confusing from a procedural point of view, because then you don’t know if that person is doing it or somebody else is doing it,” he said. “We don't want people sharing login information for any secure system, because God forbid you share it with somebody that shouldn't have access to it.”

The internal investigation is ongoing, so LMPD has not released a determination on whether Troutman actually did share his login credentials with anyone or if his license plate reader searches violated any department rules.

Public records show LMPD’s investigation of Troutman is not only looking at the 100-plus searches that used the ICE-related acronym, but also another 27 searches Troutman made that listed “Immigration” as the reason.

LMPD spokesperson Sgt. Matt Sanders previously told KyCIR Troutman’s searches using the “Immigration” keyword were actually related “to criminal activity, not immigration status” and that department officials “found no evidence of misuse.”

Records show Humphrey also ordered LMPD’s internal investigation to look at Troutman’s conduct related to June 19 and Oct. 28 memos he prepared “in response to official requests for a memo related to” his Flock searches.",Immigration
"Immigration hardliners across Washington are using last week’s shooting of two National Guard members to push the Trump administration to further limit who can enter the U.S., well beyond restrictions the White House has taken in the immediate aftermath of the attack.

A number of lawmakers and Trump administration officials view the shooting — by an Afghan man who’d been granted asylum — as an opportunity for an aggressive effort to load on new layers of screening of would-be migrants and asylum seekers across the world.

Proposals range from mandatory in-person interviews for asylum applicants to deporting millions of people the administration says entered the U.S. without adequate vetting from the Biden administration. Other suggestions include a variety of additional checks to reveal any connections to terror groups.

An administration official said to “expect a full overhaul of all adjudications,” adding: “We are at a critical moment of vetting foreign nationals, not just those from typical countries of concern.”

The official, like others, was granted anonymity to speak freely about the evolving plans within the U.S. government to respond to the shooting of two members of the West Virginia National Guard that killed one soldier and left another in critical condition.

“We need to screen and screen and screen some more because really and truly this is a tragedy beyond belief,” said West Virginia Republican Sen. Jim Justice. “If I were President Trump, I would say, ‘If you think there’s a better way, then fix it.’”

Since the shooting, the Trump administration has moved to freeze visa and asylum applications from Afghan nationals, and said it will audit green cards issued to individuals from 19 countries. Trump has also said the U.S. must “reexamine” all Afghans who came to the U.S. under Biden, and vowed to “permanently pause” immigration from all “third world countries.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem appears eager to go further. She posted on X on Monday that she has recommended the president expand travel bans “on every damn country that’s been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”

“There were some plans already afoot to find ways to revisit some of these cases. It was kind of tinkering around the edges,” said one person close to the administration. “But now, it’s going to be much more systematic, and I suspect they’re going to have to devote more resources to it.”

“I would call it an inflection point,” the person added.

Some of the proposals add procedural barriers. Immigration hawks on Capitol Hill are arguing for U.S. officials to restore standards a government commission convened after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to root out potential security threats.

Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who has pushed for legislation restoring those strict screening requirements, argued that chief among those steps would be the resumption in-person interviews for asylum applicants and more rigorous reviews to determine if an applicant has any ties to terrorist organizations.

“Does that take time? Of course it does, which is the point. I mean, the point is to zero in and make a judgment about each person you’re letting in because who knows how long they’ll be here,” Hawley said in an interview.

The alleged shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was an Afghan national who entered the country in 2021 on humanitarian parole. His application for asylum was approved in 2025 under the Trump administration. While Trump and other Cabinet officials alleged shortly after the shooting that the Biden administration did “zero vetting” of him, administration officials later said the vetting was insufficient.

It’s unclear what inspired Lakanwal, who worked with a CIA-backed paramilitary force in Afghanistan, to carry out the shooting but reports have documented mental health concerns. Noem had said shortly after his arrest that Lakanwal was “radicalized” in the United States.

Some of the plans under consideration would be unprecedented in scope. Two senior intelligence officials said that people who work in the National Counterterrorism Center are actively pushing the White House on a hardline plan to deport some 2 million people from mostly Muslim countries who entered the U.S. under Biden — and force them to reapply from abroad if they want to return.

The first intelligence official declined to explain how the NCTC arrived at the figure of 2 million.

Joe Kent, the head of the NCTC, has already floated the idea in public, advocating for retroactively vetting recent arrivals to the U.S. and deporting those “illegally admitted” under Biden on his social media account.

Olivia Coleman, a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said NCTC “fully supports the mission to undo the damage caused by the previous administration’s lax vetting standards and get these monsters out of our country.”

Coleman also pledged that NCTC will “continue our efforts to identify individuals with terrorist ties, rigorously vet them, and equip DHS with the intelligence needed to remove these criminals from our country.”

The calls for more action are being amplified by long-time advocates for restricting legal pathways for migrants to enter the United States. They argue that the Biden administration conducted meager screening of visa applicants.

“Many of them were, at best, very, very superficially vetted. Many probably weren’t vetted at all, and we’ve been paying the price for it. Not just with this attack on the National Guard, but in terms of criminal gangs moving in,” said Ira Mehlman of the Federation for American Immigration Reform think tank in Washington, which favors restrictions on legal pathways to emigrate to the United States.

Under multiple administrations, including under Biden, migrants and asylum seekers have been generally screened for ties to terrorist groups and potential threats they may pose to U.S. national security based on information available in federal databases. Afghan nationals who worked with the U.S. in Afghanistan — and therefore qualified to apply for a special visa — were typically initially vetted by military personnel at bases overseas. And not all Afghan refugees were offered humanitarian parole. Many still wait at U.S. military bases and refugee camps around the world for a small number of Special Immigrant Visas that would allow them to enter the United States.

Still, the Biden administration’s process was criticized in a 2022 Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General report, which found that federal officials “did not always have critical data” to properly vet Afghan refugees.

In a letter Friday, all eight Republicans on the Senate Intelligence panel urged acting national security adviser Marco Rubio to fully implement the recommendations of the OIG report and to remove Afghan “evacuees” deemed a security risk.

Not all of the White House’s allies are pushing for immediate and dramatic action. Some Republicans are voicing caution, wanting to learn more about the shooter before pushing for major changes.

“Secretary Noem says that he was radicalized after he came to the United States, and that may be, but we just don’t have the facts yet,” said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), who in the past has supported visa programs for Afghans who helped the U.S. in its two-decade war. “We don’t have the facts about the extent to which, if any, President Biden’s administration vetted the folks. We were told they would all be vetted, but we don’t know if that was the case or not.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is “working to implement the most rigorous screening and vetting protocols in agency history” as a way to correct damage from the Biden administration’s “reckless approach” to refugee settlement. McLaughlin added that the Trump administration is “reviewing all immigration benefits granted by the Biden administration to aliens from countries of concern.”

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Trump is “fulfilling his promise every day and any policy changes needed to more effectively achieve” his goal to “put America first and carry out the largest mass deportation operation in history.”

Much of what the administration has carried out in recent days has built on its gradual steps to increase scrutiny of applications and reduce pathways to legally enter the United States, said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, an immigration lawyer who works as an analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.

“It’s an escalation, but it’s building on these already extraordinary measures that they had been taking or trying to take,” Bush-Joseph said.

Among the changes, Bush-Joseph said, could be the reintroduction of rules around asylum introduced during the first Trump presidency. Many of those rules were blocked in the courts during Trump’s first term, but the administration has already shown a willingness to revamp other immigration policies that were hampered by litigation back then, such as changes to the diversity visa lottery.

Ken Cuccinelli, who served as acting deputy DHS secretary during the first Trump administration and wrote the chapter of a 2024 Heritage Foundation report that previewed many of the immigration policy changes Trump has since made, said that the administration should pursue a three-pronged policy of blocking new applicants from countries where vetting is impossible, re-vetting all applicants in the U.S. from those nations and deporting anyone who cannot be properly screened.

How far the efforts will go to re-screen foreign nationals is unclear. The first senior intelligence official said that senior White House officials have been briefed on the plan to deport the 2 million migrants from counterterrorism officials.

The second senior intelligence official cautioned that “a lot of things are floating around right now” in response to the shooting, but confirmed this idea was one of them.

In the interim, the political pressure is bubbling to the surface, as even lawmakers who have historically backed programs that grant Afghans and others who supported the U.S. military entry to the United States are acknowledging a need for more vetting.

“I am all about allowing those that assisted our military passage into the United States. I am very firm on that,” said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa). “But they must be properly vetted and we know that this was not done.”",Immigration
